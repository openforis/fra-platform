Any changes of these overlapping variables can be done only through the FRA 2025 platform.

2. Prefilling: This table has not been prefilled.

3. The 2025 Questionnaire does not propose any definition of forest degradation.​ It is up to the countries to define the thresholds for the minimum size of degraded forest land and other wooded land to be reported as well as for criteria and detailed thresholds used to determine area as “degraded”.
   In reporting to this indicator National Correspondents might be guided by the understanding that:​ Forest Degradation occurs when the recovery process of damaged forest is hampered due to the continued (long-term) impact of degrading agents, or other conditions limiting natural recovery; ​
   Often the recovery cannot be implemented without of external intervention.​

4. It is recommended to report only degradation that results in significantly affected components of forest ecosystems.

5. National Correspondents are asked for degraded area present in a reference year.

If data are available for sub-class “Forest” only, please report on this sub-class and provide note under “Country comments”. If data are available only for certain forest areas or ownership classes (e.g. state forests), but not for others, data should be reported for these areas or classes, which should be specified in “Country comments”.

6.  Currency: Figures for each year should be reported in national currency. Countries should explicitly state what national currency is reported (and for what years if differing) in the table A page 6.

7.  “Gross fixed capital formation” is defined as part of the national accounts system, and reflects trends in investment. It is defined as resident producers´ acquisitions less disposals of fixed assets during the accounting period plus certain additions to the value of non-produced assets (such as improvements in the quality or productivity of land) realised by the productive activity of producer or institutional units. Fixed assets are produced assets used in the production for more than one year. For this purpose gross fixed capital formation include: investments in accordance with the national tax laws (construction and maintenance of forest roads, buildings; investments to equipment, tools, vehicles, machinery and technologies and other investments e.g. IT and/or intangible investments etc.). Gross fixed capital formation is valued at purchasers´ prices, including installation charges and other costs of ownership transfer. “Gross fixed capital formation” are reported within three subcategories: “Gross fixed capital formation in planting of trees to provide regular income”, “Gross fixed capital formation in equipment and buildings” and “Other gross fixed capital formation”.

8.  “Gross fixed capital formation in planting of trees to provide regular income” includes cultivation of land to create new forest plantations as mean of production of forest products (e.g. cork, natural gum and similar products). Fixed assets must provide annual income.

9.  “Gross fixed capital formation in equipment and buildings” includes machinery and other equipment, transport equipment, non-residential forestry buildings, forest roads and paths

10.  “Other gross fixed capital formation” includes software, management plans, major improvements to forest land (drainage, preparing soil, protection structure etc.) and other

11.  “Fixed capital consumption” is the value of the depreciation of fixed capital goods as a result of normal wear and tear in the course of production process.

12.  “Capital transfers” include all receivable capital transfers, i.e. investment grants and other capital transfers. Investments grants are capital transfers, in cash or kind, effected by general government or the rest of the world to other resident or non-resident institutional units with the aim of financing, in part or in full, the cost of acquiring fixed capital goods. Investments grants from the rest of the world comprise those granted directly by the institutions of the European Union. Interest subsidies are not included under investments grants, even if they are intended to facilitate investments transactions. Other capital transfers cover transfers which redistribute saving or wealth among the different sectors of the economy. Other capital transfers may take the form of compensation to owners of capital goods that had been destroyed by acts of war or natural disasters, such as floods, etc. Other capital transfers also include compensation for exceptional losses of fixed capital goods used in the production of forestry goods and grants to compensate for reduction in the value of assets or to reduce debts. Investments grants and other capital transfers should be recorded when payment is due.

8.  A forest recreational facility is a public or private facility used for recreational purposes such as buildings, constructions and infrastructure located only "within" the "Area available for public recreation" or, if outside, managed by forestry bodies (owners and/or managers). The interpretation of “within” forests can be based on country specifics – it does not necessarily mean the forest land according to country’s legislation. Facilities surrounded by forest that are legally consider as non-forest land (e.g built-up area) can be also included, if appropriate.

9.  Designated paths and roads means either marked with orientation marks in the field or otherwise publicised.

10.  Countries are invited to the pilot voluntary reporting also on other recreational facilities operated for recreation in forests in the Table 6.10d. Purpose of this reporting is to test availability and comparability of the particular data, to collect information on definitions as well as feasibility of such a survey. In case of availability of the reliable national data, countries could report relevant facilities, assigning them to the most detailed category from the list below:
