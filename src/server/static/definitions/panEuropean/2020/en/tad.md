## Criterion I

# 1.1 Indicator 1.1

### Forest
>Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.

**Explanatory notes**

1. Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters.

2. Includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of  5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used.

3. Includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.

4. Includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.

5. Includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or  are expected to reach, a canopy cover of  at least 10 percent and tree height of  at least 5 meters.

6. Includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not.

7. Includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.

8. Includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met.

9. Includes areas outside the legally designated forest land which meet the definition of “forest”.

10. Excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover.  Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the “Taungya” system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest.

### Forest available for wood supply
>Forests where there are no environmental, social or economic restrictions that could have a signiﬁcant impact on the current or potential supply of wood. These restrictions could be based on legal acts, managerial owners' decisions or other reasons.

**Explanatory notes**

1. Environmental restrictions should consider: protected areas, protected habitats or species, and also those protective forests meeting the above requirements. Age or diameter class restriction should not be taken into account (except in the case of protected ancient forest).

2. Social restrictions include restrictions to protect aesthetic, historical, cultural, spiritual, or recreational values as well as areas where the owner has made the decision to cease wood harvesting in order to focus on other goods and services (e.g. leisure, landscape, aesthetic value).

3. The economic restrictions are considered as those affecting the economic value of wood utilisation (proﬁtability). These includes: accessibility, slope and soil condition. Short-term market ﬂuctuations should not be considered.

4. A signiﬁcant impact occurs when harvesting is totally prohibited or when restrictions severely limit the feasibility of cuttings for commercial purposes.

5. When restrictions do not severely limit commercial utilisation of wood in an area, it should be considered available for wood supply even if current harvesting is for auto-consumption or no harvest at all is taking place. Conversely, when restrictions limit the feasibility of commercial wood utilisation, even if there is occasional cuttings for auto-consumption or other small-scale interventions of a non-commercial nature, the forest should be considered as FNAWS.

6. Regarding the assessment of availability for wood supply, the following recommendations were proposed for reporting: (i) the three different categories should be accounted for separately if possible (environmental, social, and economic); (ii) restrictions considered for each category should be detailed if possible (e.g. protected areas, protected species).

# Criterion VI

# 6.1 Indicator 6.1

### Forest ownership

>Generally refers to the legal right to freely and exclusively use, control, transfer, or otherwise benefit from a forest. Ownership can be acquired through transfers such as sales, donations, and inheritance.

**Explanatory notes**

1. For this reporting table, forest ownership refers to the ownership of the trees growing on land classified as forest, regardless of whether or not the ownership of these trees coincides with the ownership of the land itself.

*(Source: FRA 2025)*

### Public ownership

>Forest owned by the State; or administrative units of the Public Administration; or by institutions or corporations owned by the Public Administration.

**Explanatory notes**

1. Includes all the hierarchical levels of Public Administration within a country, e.g. State, Province and Municipality.

2. Shareholder corporations that are partially State-owned, are considered as under public ownership when the State holds a majority of the shares.

3. Public ownership may exclude the possibility to transfer.

*(Source: FRA 2025)*

### Private ownership

>Forest owned by individuals, families, communities, private cooperatives, corporations and other business entities, private religious and educational institutions, pension or investment funds, NGOs, nature conservation associations and other private institutions.

*(Source: FRA 2025)*

### Other types of ownership/unknown

>Other kinds of ownership arrangements not covered by public or private ownership or forest area where ownership is unknown.

**Explanatory notes**

1.  Includes areas where ownership is unclear or disputed.

*(Source: FRA 2025)*

### Forest holding

>One or more parcels of forest and other wooded land which constitute a single unit from the point of view of management or utilization. For State-owned forest and other wooded land a holding may be defined as the area forming a major management unit administered by a senior official, e.g. a Regional Forestry Officer. For forest and other wooded land that is owned publicly, other than by the State, or owned by large-scale forest owners, e.g. forest industries, a holding may constitute a number of separated properties which are, however, managed according to one corporate strategy. Under any category of ownership, other than State-owned, one holding may be the property of one or several owners.

*(Source: TBFRA 2000, definition as published in SoEF 2007).*

## 6.2 Indicator 6.2

### Gross Domestic Product

>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given year. It is equal to total consumer, investment and government spending, plus the value of exports, minus the value of imports. For the estimation of an industry’s contribution to GDP, data on Gross Value Added (GVA) should be used. The link between GVA and GDP can be defined as: GVA + taxes on products - subsidies on products = GDP.

### Gross Value Added

>Gross Value Added (GVA) measures the contribution to the economy of each individual producer, industry or sector in the country, measured at basic prices. Data on GVA for each industrial sector should be available from the National Accounts prepared by the country’s national statistical authority.

### ISIC/NACE

>ISIC is the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities. NACE is the equivalent Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community.

>In ISIC Rev 4 (2008) and NACE Rev 2 (2008), the following categories cover forest industries:

- 02: Forestry and logging.

- 16: Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials.

- 17: Manufacture of paper and paper products.

>In the previously used ISIC Rev 3.1 (2004) and NACE Rev 1.1 (2002), the corresponding categories were: 02, 20 and 21 (with some minor additions / subtractions). For the reporting years 1990, 2000 and 2005 the corresponding former NACE/ISIC categories 02, 20, 21 can be used. Adjustments from the old to the new NACE/ISIC are not needed.

### Forestry and logging (ISIC/NACE 02)

>This division includes the production of roundwood for the forest-based manufacturing industries (ISIC divisions 16 and 17) as well as the extraction and gathering of wild growing non-wood forest products. Besides the production of timber, forestry activities result in products that undergo little processing, such as fire wood, charcoal, wood chips and roundwood used in an unprocessed form (e.g. pit-props, pulpwood etc.). These activities can be carried out in natural or planted forests.

>The major categories covered by this class are:

- 021 Silviculture and other forestry activities

- 022 Logging

- 023 Gathering of non-wood forest products

- 024 Support services to forestry

*(Source: International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), Revision 4, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Statistical Division, United Nations, New York, 2008, page 75)*

### Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials (ISIC/NACE 16)

>This division includes the manufacture of wood products, such as lumber, plywood, veneers, wood containers, wood flooring, wood trusses, and prefabricated wood buildings. The production processes include sawing, planing, shaping, laminating, and assembling of wood products starting from logs that are cut into bolts, or lumber that may then be cut further, or shaped by lathes or other shaping tools. The lumber or other transformed wood shapes may also be subsequently planed or smoothed, and assembled into finished products, such as wood containers.

>With the exception of sawmilling, this division is subdivided mainly based on the specific products manufactured. This division does not include the manufacture of furniture (3100), or the installation of wooden fittings and the like (4330).

>The major categories covered by this class are:

- 161 Sawmilling and planing of wood,

- 162 Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials.

*(Source: International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), Revision 4, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Statistical Division, United Nations, New York, 2008, page 102)*

### Manufacture of paper and paper products (ISIC/NACE 17)

>This division includes the manufacture of pulp, paper and converted paper products. The manufacture of these products is grouped together because they constitute a series of vertically connected processes. More than one activity is often carried out in a single unit. There are essentially three activities: The manufacture of pulp involves separating the cellulose fibers from other impurities in wood or used paper. The manufacture of paper involves matting these fibers into a sheet. Converted paper products are made from paper and other materials by various cutting and shaping techniques, including coating and laminating activities. The paper articles may be printed (e.g. wallpaper, gift wrap etc.), as long as the printing of information is not the main purpose.

>The production of pulp, paper and paperboard in bulk is included in class 1701, while the remaining classes include the production of further-processed paper and paper products.

*(Source: International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), Revision 4, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Statistical Division, United Nations, New York, 2008, page 105)*

## 6.3 Indicator 6.3

### Factor income

>Factor income measures the remuneration of all factors of production (land, capital, labour) and represents all the value generated by a unit engaged in a production activity. It can be derived from Gross Value Added (GVA) by deducting fixed capital consumption (depreciation) to get net value added, and then adjusting from basic prices to factor cost by subtracting any taxes on production and adding any subsidies on production.

### Net operating surplus

>Net operating surplus can be derived from factor income by subtracting compensation of employees.

### Net entrepreneurial income

>Net entrepreneurial income measures the return to the forestry business owner, and consists of the compensation of unpaid labour, remuneration from land belonging to units and the yield arising from the use of capital. It can be derived from factor income by subtracting compensation of employees to get operating surplus, and then adding any interest received by forestry units organized as companies and deducting any rent and interest payments.

# 6.4 Indicator 6.4

### HeadingCapital transfers

>“Capital transfers” include all receivable capital transfers, i.e. investment grants and other capital transfers. Investments grants are capital transfers, in cash or kind, effected by general government or the rest of the world to other resident or non-resident institutional units with the aim of financing, in part or in full, the cost of acquiring fixed capital goods. Investments grants from the rest of the world comprise those granted directly by the institutions of the European Union. Interest subsidies are not included under investments grants, even if they are intended to facilitate investments transactions. Other capital transfers cover transfers which redistribute saving or wealth among the different sectors of the economy. Other capital transfers may take the form of compensation to owners of capital goods that had been destroyed by acts of war or natural disasters, such as floods, etc. Other capital transfers also include compensation for exceptional losses of fixed capital goods used in the production of forestry goods and grants to compensate for reduction in the value of assets or to reduce debts. Investments grants and other capital transfers should be recorded when payment is due.

### Fixed capital consumption

>“Fixed capital consumption” is the value of the depreciation of fixed capital goods as a result of normal wear and tear in the course of production process.

### Gross fixed capital formation

>“Gross fixed capital formation” is defined as part of the national accounts system, and reflects trends in investment. It is defined as resident producers´ acquisitions less disposals of fixed assets during the accounting period plus certain additions to the value of non-produced assets (such as improvements in the quality or productivity of land) realised by the productive activity of producer or institutional units. Fixed assets are produced assets used in the production for more than one year. For this purpose gross fixed capital formation include: investments in accordance with the national tax laws (construction and maintenance of forest roads, buildings; investments to equipment, tools, vehicles, machinery and technologies and other investments e.g. IT and/or intangible investments etc.). Gross fixed capital formation is valued at purchasers´ prices, including installation charges and other costs of ownership transfer. “Gross fixed capital formation” is reported within three subcategories: “Gross fixed capital formation in planting of trees to provide regular income”, “Gross fixed capital formation in equipment and buildings” and “Other gross fixed capital formation”.

>“Gross fixed capital formation in planting of trees to provide regular income” includes cultivation of land to create new forest plantations as mean of production of forest products (e.g. cork, natural gum and similar products). Fixed assets must provide annual income.

>“Gross fixed capital formation in equipment and buildings” includes machinery and other equipment, transport equipment, non-residential forestry buildings, forest roads and paths.

>“Other gross fixed capital formation” includes software, management plans, major improvements to forest land (drainage, preparing soil, protection structure etc.) and other.

# 6.5 indicator 6.5

### Labour Force Survey

>The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a sample survey carried out in many European countries by interviewing individuals about their personal circumstances and work. Because the LFS is a sample survey, results are subject to sampling error, i.e. the actual proportion of the population in private households with a particular characteristic may differ from the proportion of the LFS sample with that characteristic.

>The LFS provides information about people in unemployment and employment. The LFS defines employment as those people aged 16 and over who did at least one hour’s paid work in the reference week (either as an employee or self-employed); those who had a job which they were temporarily away from (on holiday for example); those participating in government training and employment programmes; and those doing unpaid family work.

### Education

>The main levels of the International Standard Classification of Education (Source: ISCED 1997), applied from 1998 data onwards, are:

- ISCED 0 – pre-primary education

- ISCED 1 – primary education or first stage of basic education

- ISCED 2 – lower secondary education or second stage of basic education

- ISCED 3 - (upper) secondary education

- ISCED 4 – post-secondary non tertiary education

- ISCED 5 – first stage of tertiary education (not leading directly to an advanced research qualification)

- ISCED 6 –  second stage of tertiary education (leading to and advanced research qualification)

>For further information visit  <http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/aims/ISCED_A.pdf>

### Job characteristics

>Those who own and operate their own business or professional practice, sometimes in conjunction with a partner, are considered as self-employed. The Labour Force Survey (LFS) asks a number of questions to establish a person's employment status; this is based on a respondent's own opinion of whether they are an employee or self-employed. If a different source is used, a relevant distinction is that employees work for wage or salary (in cash or kind) while the self-employed work for profit or family gain (in cash or kind). Family workers are persons doing unpaid work for a business they own or for a business that a relative owns.

**Explanatory notes**

1. For the purpose of this reporting unpaid family workers should be included in self-employed.

# 6.6 indicator 6.6

### Occupational accident

### Visit

>A “Visit” is a visit for recreational purposes to any area of forest or other wooded land. There is no minimum duration and it is not necessary to undertake any specific activities. Visits for work purposes and travel through the forest for purposes other than recreation are excluded. Each individual participant, including children, counts as one visit. If several different forests are visited on one trip, then the trip only counts as one visit, but if an individual makes two or more separate trips to forests during one day, then each counts as a separate visit.
