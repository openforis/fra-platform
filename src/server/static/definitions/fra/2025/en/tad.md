# Terms and Definitions

_FRA 2025_

## Introduction <!-- section:Introduction -->

The FAO Global Forest Resources Assessments have to a great extent contributed to the improvement of concepts, definitions and methods related to forest resources assessments. 

Strong efforts have been made to harmonize and streamline reporting with other international forest-related processes e.g. within the framework of the Collaborative Partnership on Forest (CPF), as well as with the partner organizations of the Collaborative Forest Resources Questionnaire (CFRQ) and the scientific community, all in order to harmonize and improve forest related definitions and reduce reporting burden on countries. The core definitions build on earlier global assessments to ensure comparability over time. Whenever new definitions are introduced or old definitions modified this is done taking into consideration recommendations from experts in various fora.

Variations in definitions, however minor, will increase the risk of inconsistency in reporting over time. High importance is thus given to ensure the continuity of the definitions as applied in previous assessments in order to allow consistency of data over time whenever possible.

The global definitions are in a sense compromises and their application is subject to interpretation. Reducing national classifications to a set of global classes is a challenge and sometimes assumptions and approximations must be made. 

In order to compare and combine data from different sources, it is important to use statistics that are collected using comparable terminology, definitions and measurement units. This working paper includes the terms and definitions applied in the country reporting process for FRA 2025 and should be regarded as an authoritative document on the terms and definitions. The working paper can be used in meetings and training at all levels aiming to build national capacity for forest resources assessment and reporting in general.

# 1 Forest extent, characteristics and changes <!-- section:1 -->

## 1a Extent of forest and other wooded land <!-- section:1a -->

### FOREST

> Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with **trees** higher than 5 meters and a **canopy cover** of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds *in situ*. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. 

Explanatory notes

1.	Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters *in situ*. 
2.	Includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used.
3.	Includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.
4.	Includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.
5.	Includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters.
6.	Includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not.
7.	Includes rubber-wood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations. 
8.	Includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met.
9.	Includes areas outside the legally designated forest land which meet the definition of “forest”.
10.	**Excludes** tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover.  Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the “Taungya” system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest.

### OTHER WOODED LAND

> Land not classified as **Forest**, spanning more than 0.5 hectares; with **trees** higher than 5 meters and a **canopy cover** of 5-10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds *in situ*; or with a combined cover of **shrubs**, bushes and trees above 10 percent. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.

Explanatory notes

1. The definition above has two options:
    - The canopy cover of trees is between 5 and 10 percent; trees should be higher than 5 meters or able to reach 5 meters *in situ*. 
OR
    - The canopy cover of trees is less than 5 percent but the combined cover of shrubs, bushes and trees is more than 10 percent. Includes areas of shrubs and bushes where no trees are present.
2. Includes areas with trees that will not reach a height of 5 meters *in situ* and with a canopy cover of 10 percent or more, e.g. some alpine tree vegetation types, arid zone mangroves, etc.

### REMAINING LAND AREA

> All land that is not classified as **Forest** or **Other wooded land**.

Explanatory notes

1. For the purpose of reporting to FRA, the "Other land" is calculated by subtracting the area of forest and other wooded land from the total land area (as maintained by FAOSTAT).
2. Includes agricultural land, meadows and pastures, built-up areas, barren land, land under permanent ice, etc. 
3. Includes all areas classified under the sub-category "Other land with tree cover".

<br>i.	they show natural forest dynamics, such as natural tree species composition, occurrence of dead wood, natural age structure, and natural regeneration processes;
<br>ii.	the area is large enough and retains a degree of connectivity such that its natural ecological processes are maintained; and
