# 1a Extent of forest and other wooded land <!-- section:1a -->

### Can I correct or change previously reported figures?

If new data have become available since last reporting, you may need to also change the historical figures as the new data most likely will affect the trends. Likewise, if you notice that some errors were made in the estimations for FRA 2020, these should be corrected accordingly. Whenever, previously reported figures are changed, the justification should be clearly documented in the comments to the table.

### Can sub-national level information on forest area be used to improve/generate national level estimates? 

If boundaries of the sub-national units are consistent and definitions compatible, sub-national level information can be aggregated to generate a composite national level estimate through addition of the sub-national figures. Where definitions/classifications differ, harmonization of national classes or reclassification to the FRA categories should be done prior to adding the various estimates. 

### How does one address the problem of different reference years for sub-national level figures used to generate an aggregated national estimate? 

First bring the different estimates to a common reference year through inter/extrapolation, then add the sub-national figures.

### When it is difficult to reclassify national classes into FRA categories, can I use and report data for the national classes as a proxy for the FRA categories?

It is important that the time series reported to FRA are consistent. If the national categories are reasonably close to the FRA categories countries may use these as long as this is clearly documented in the country report. However, if the national categories differ substantially from the FRA categories, countries should try reclassifying the national data to the FRA categories. When in doubt, please contact the FRA secretariat. 

### What should I do when the national datasets from different years use different definitions and classifications? 

In order to build a time series, these datasets must first be brought to a common classification system. Usually the best way is to first reclassify both datasets to FRA classes, before making the estimation and forecasting.

### Mangroves are found below the tidal level and are not part of the total land area, how should they be accounted for in forest area? 

Most mangroves are located in the inter-tidal zone i.e. above the daily low tide, but below the high water mark. The land area according to country definitions may or may not include the inter-tidal zone. For, all mangroves which meet the criteria of “forest” or “other wooded land” should be included in the respective category in the forest area, even when they are found in areas not classified by the country as land area.  When necessary, the area of “other land” should be adjusted in order to ensure that the total land area matches the official figures as maintained by FAO and the UN Statistics Division and a comment about this adjustment included in the comment field to the table.

### What estimate should I use for 1990? Our estimate at the time or an estimate projected back from the latest inventory? 

The estimate for 1990 should be based on the most accurate information available, not necessarily a repetition of a previous estimate or the result of an inventory/assessment undertaken in or just prior to 1990. Where a time series is available for a time period before 1990, the estimate for 1990 can be calculated by simple interpolation. If the latest inventory is considered more accurate than earlier inventories, then this should be taken into account and an attempt made to project the results back in time. 

### How should I report forest fallows / abandoned “shifting cultivation”?

It depends on how you consider the future land use. Long fallows, in which the woody fallow period is longer than the cropping period and trees reach at least 5 m in height should be considered as “forest”. Short fallows in the cropping period is greater or equal to the fallow period and/or woody vegetation does not reach 5 m during the fallow period should be classified as “other land” and, when relevant, as “other land with tree cover” since the main land use is agriculture.

### How should “young forests” be classified? 

Young forest should be classified as “forest” if the land use criterion is met and the trees are capable of reaching 5 m in height.

### Where should line be drawn between “forest” and agricultural tree crops (fruit plantations, rubber plantations, etc.). For example: How to classify a plantation of Pinus pinea with the main objective of harvesting pine nuts? Is it an agricultural tree crop or is it a forest where NWFP are harvested? 

Rubber plantations should always be classified as “forest” (see explanatory note 7 under the definition of forest). Fruit tree plantations should be classified as “Other land with tree cover”. The general rule is that if the plantation is made up of forest tree species, it should be classified as “forest”. The case of the Pinus pinea plantation for pine nut production should therefore be classified as “forest” and the harvested pine nuts should be reported as NWFP if they are traded commercially. 

### How do I report on areas of bush-like formations (e.g. in the Mediterranean countries) with a height of about 5m? 

If the woody vegetation has more than 10% canopy cover of tree species with a height or expected height of 5 m or more, it should be classified as “forest”, otherwise it should be classified as “Other wooded land”. 

### How to report when national data are using different thresholds than FRA definition of forest?

Sometimes national data do not allow making estimates with exactly the thresholds specified in the FRA definition. In such cases countries should report according to national thresholds and clearly document the thresholds used in the comments to the table. The same threshold must be used consistently throughout the time series.

### How does the FRA definition of forest correspond with the definition of forest in other international reporting processes?

The definition of forest used for reporting to FRA is generally accepted and used by other reporting processes. However, in the specific case of the UNFCCC, the IPCC guidelines for country reporting on greenhouse gas emissions allow for certain flexibility in the national definition of forest, stating that the country can choose the thresholds of the following parameters, allowed interval within parenthesis:

-	minimum area (0.05 – 1.0 hectares)
-	tree crown cover (10 – 30 per cent)
-	tree height (2 – 5 meters)

The thresholds should be selected by the country at the first national communication and must then be kept the same for subsequent national communications.  

### How should I classify power lines? 

Power and telephone lines less than 20 m wide and crossing through forest areas should be classified as “forest”. In all other cases they should be classified as “other land”. 

# 1b Forest characteristics <!-- section:1b -->

###  How should I report areas where enrichment planting has been carried out?

If it is expected that the planted trees will dominate the future stand, then it should be considered as “other planted forest”; if the intensity is so low that the planted or seeded trees  will have only a minor share of the future growing stock, it should be considered as naturally regenerating forest.

### How should I report when it is difficult to distinguish whether a forest is planted or naturally regenerated?

If it is not possible to distinguish whether planted or naturally regenerated, and there is no auxiliary information available that indicates that it was planted, it should be reported as “naturally regenerating forest”.

### How should I report areas with naturalized species, i.e. species that were introduced a long time ago and which are now naturalized in the forest?

Areas with naturalized species that are naturally regenerated should be reported as “naturally regenerating forest”. 

### How should I interpret “clearly visible indication of human activities” in order to distinguish between “primary forest” and “naturally regenerating forest”? 

Almost all forests have been affected one way or another by human activities for commercial or for subsistence purposes by logging and/or collection of non-wood forest products, either recently or in the distant past. The general rule is that if the activities have been of such a low impact that the ecological processes have not been visibly disturbed, the forest should be classified as Primary. This would allow for including activities such as a non-destructive collection of NWFP. Likewise it may include areas where a few trees have been extracted as long as this happened a long time ago. 

### Can I use the area of forest in protected areas as a proxy for reporting on area of primary forest?

In some cases, the area of forest in protected areas is the only information available that can be used as a proxy for the area of primary forest. However, this is a very weak proxy subject to major errors which should only be used where there are no better alternatives. Caution should be employed when reporting time series, because establishing new protected areas does not mean that the area of primary forest increases.

### How can the ITTO classification of forests be translated to the FRA categories on forest characteristics?

ITTO defines primary forest as follows:

_“Forest which has never been subject to human disturbance, or has been so little affected by hunting and gathering that its natural structure, functions and dynamics have not undergone any unnatural change.”_

This category can be considered equivalent to the FRA definition of primary forest. ITTO defines a degraded primary forest as follows:

_“Primary forest in which the initial cover has been adversely affected by the unsustainable harvesting of wood and/or non-wood forest products so that its structure, processes, functions and dynamics are altered beyond the short-term resilience of the ecosystem; that is, the capacity of the forest to fully recover from exploitation in the near to medium term has been compromised).”_

This definition falls within the FRA definition of “naturally regenerating forests”. ITTO defines a managed primary forest as follows:

_“Forest in which sustainable timber and non-wood harvesting (e.g. through integrated harvesting and silvicultural treatments), wildlife management and other uses have changed forest structure and species composition from the original primary forest. All major goods and services are maintained.”_ 

Also this definition falls within the FRA definition of “naturally regenerating forests” and outside the FRA definition of primary forest.

### Some forests are regularly affected by severe disturbances (such as hurricanes) and will never reach a “stable” climax state, but still there are substantial areas with no visible human impact.  Should these be classified as primary forest (despite the visible hurricane impact)?  

Yes, a disturbed forest with no visible human impact and with a species composition and structure that resembles a mature or close-to-mature forest should be classified as “primary”, while a severely damaged forest with an age structure and species composition which is significantly different from a mature forest should be classified as a “naturally regenerating forest”. See also Explanatory note 1 to the definition of Primary Forest.

### What species should be considered as mangroves? 

FRA uses the definition of mangroves as of Tomlinson’s Botany of Mangroves, where the following are listed as “true mangrove species”:

# 1d Annual forest expansion, deforestation and net change <!-- section:1d -->

### When do I consider that abandoned land has reverted to forest and therefore should be included under “natural expansion of forest”?

It should fulfil the following:
	-	having been abandoned from previous land use for a period of time and be expected to revert to forest. There should not be any indications that it will go back to previous land use. The period of time may be chosen by the country and should be documented in a note in appropriate comment field. 
	-	have regeneration of trees that are expected to comply to the definitions of forest.

### What is the difference between afforestation and reforestation?

Afforestation is the planting/seeding of trees on areas that previously were either other wooded land or other land. Reforestation on the other hand takes place in areas that already are classified as forest and does not imply any change of land use from a non-forest use to forest. 

### Are the FRA definitions of afforestation and reforestation the same as is used in the IPCC guidelines for greenhouse gas reporting?

No, the terminology on afforestation and reforestation is different. In the IPCC guidelines, both afforestation and reforestation imply a land use change and correspond to the FRA term afforestation, while the IPCC term revegetation corresponds approximately to the FRA term reforestation. 

# 1e Other land with tree cover <!-- section:1e -->

### How should areas under multiple land use (agroforestry, forest grazing, etc.) be classified in a consistent way, when no land use is considered significantly more important than the others?

Agroforestry systems where crops are grown under tree cover are generally classified as “Other land with tree cover”, however some agroforestry systems such as the Taungya system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as “forest”. In the case of forest grazing (i.e. grazing on land that fulfil the requirements of canopy cover and tree height), the general rule is to include the forest pastures in the area of Forest, unless the grazing is so intensive that it becomes the predominant land use, in which case the land should be classified as “Other land with tree cover”. 

### How to classify seed orchards?

Seed orchards of forest tree species are considered as forest. 

### How should we report on palm plantations?

According to the FRA definition of “forest”, oil palm plantations are specifically excluded.  Regarding other palm plantations, it is a land use issue. If managed primarily for agricultural production, food and fodder they should be classified as “other land” and – when applicable – as “…of which palms (oil, coconut, dates, etc)”. When managed primarily for production of wood and construction material and/or protection of soil and water they should be classified as either “forest” or “other wooded land” depending on the height of the trees.  In the specific case of senile coconut palm plantation, the classification depends on expected future land use. If expected to be replaced with a new coconut palm plantation or other agricultural land use it should be classified as “other land with tree cover”. If abandoned and not expected to return to agriculture, it should be classified as “forest”.

### Should natural stands of coconut palms be included in the forest area?

Yes, if it is not managed for agricultural purposes and the minimum area, crown cover and height criteria are met (see the definition of “Forest”).

# 2a Growing stock <!-- section:2a -->

### Is it possible to estimate growing stock from biomass stock using the conversion factors?

It is possible, but should be done with much caution; particularly the conversion and expansion factors need a growing stock per hectare as part of the input, so here some assumptions need to be made. Using wood density and biomass expansion factors is more straightforward.

# 2b Forest growing stock composition <!-- section:2b -->

### Does Table 2b on forest growing stock composition refer to natural forests only? 

No. All the table refer to both natural and planted forests of both native and introduced species. 

### Which reporting year should be used as reference for compiling the species list?

The ranking of species is according to volume for the year 2020.

### In table 2b, should the ranking of species be by volume, area or number of trees? 

By volume (growing stock). 

### In table 2b, is it possible to provide information by groups of species when the number of species is too large? 

Yes, if national data do not allow the distinction of individual species within certain species groups, countries may report on genera (or groups) instead of species, and make a note in relevant comment field to the table.

# 2c Biomass stock & 2d Carbon stock <!-- section:2c -->

*General methodological aspects*

For any biomass calculation, irrespective of whether for Above-ground biomass, Below-ground biomass or Dead wood, the choice of method is determined by available data and country-specific biomass estimation methods. The following list indicates some choices, starting with the method that provides the most precise estimates. 

1.	If a country has developed biomass functions for directly estimating biomass from forest inventory data or has established country-specific factors for converting growing stock to biomass, using these should be the first choice.
2.	The second choice is to use other biomass functions and/or conversion factors that are considered to give better estimates than the default regional/biome-specific conversion factors published by IPCC (e.g. functions and/or factors from neighbouring countries).
3.	The third choice is to use the automatic calculation of biomass which is using the IPCC default factors and values. For the automatic estimations of Biomass, the FRA process relies on the methodological framework developed by the IPCC and documented in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Volume 4, chapters 2 and 4.  This document is available at:  http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.htm.

### What about the biomass/carbon stock of shrubs and bushes? Should they be included or excluded? 

The IPCC guidelines states that when the forest understory is a relatively small component of the above-ground biomass, it can be excluded provided this is done in a consistent manner throughout the time series. However, in many cases shrubs and bushes are important in terms of biomass and carbon, particularly for areas classified as “other wooded land”, and should therefore be included to the extent possible. Please indicate in the relevant comment field how shrubs and bushes have been handled in your biomass estimates.

### Should I report the same figures on biomass and carbon stocks to FRA as to UNFCCC?

Not necessarily – but ideally the figures reported to UNFCCC should be based on the FRA figures and then adjusted/reclassified, when necessary, to comply with the UNFCCC definitions.

### Does “above ground biomass” include forest litter?

No, above-ground biomass only includes living biomass.

### In our national forest inventory we have biomass estimates where biomass equations have been used. Should I use these or rather use the IPCC default factors in the guidelines?

Generally, biomass equations are considered to give better estimates than default factors, but if for some reasons you believe that the use of default factors provide a more reliable estimate you may use these factors. In such case please make a comment in the report.

# 3a Designated management objective <!-- section:3a -->

### If the national legislation states that all forests should be managed for production, conservation of biodiversity and protection of soil and water, should I then report all forest area as having “multiple use” as primary designated function?

The definition of primary designation function, explanatory note 2, says that “Nation-wide function established in general clauses of national legislation or policies should not be considered as designations”. So you must instead look into what functions have been designated at management unit level.

--

# 4a Forest ownership & 4b Management rights of public forests <!-- section:4a -->

### How should I report on ownership where indigenous land overlaps protected areas?

It is the formal ownership of the forest resources that define how you should report. If the indigenous rights to the forest resources correspond to the definition of ownership, then report as “Local, tribal and indigenous communities”. Otherwise, protected areas where indigenous rights are present are likely to be of “public ownership”.

### My country has a complex land tenure regime that is difficult to fit into the FRA categories. How should I do?

Contact the FRA team for advice, describing the particular land/resource tenure regime of your country.

### Do the three sub-categories of private ownership add up to total private ownership?

Yes.

### How to classify ownership of forests planted by private companies on government land?

Sometimes, private companies are required to plant trees as part of concession or harvesting agreements. Generally speaking the planted forest is public, unless there are specific legal or contractual clauses giving the private company ownership of the planted trees, in which case they should be classified as private.

### How to classify ownership of forests on private land where a permit is needed from the authorities to cut the trees?

It depends on the legal status of the ownership of the forest. You may have forests that are legally owned by the private land owner, but the state still can enforce restrictions on harvesting and in this case it is private ownership. You may also have the case where the trees belong to the state even if the land is private. In this case it should be reported as public ownership and a note that the ownership of trees and land are different. 

### How to report on forest areas with concession rights?

Concession rights are not full ownership rights – they usually only refer to the right to harvest and responsibility to manage the forests. Forest concessions are almost always on State land and ownership is therefore “public” and management rights is “private corporations”. In the rare case when a private owner gives a concession, it should be reported on under private ownership in table 4a.

### How to report on concessions of only commercial species?

To be classified as a concession in the table 4b on management rights, the concession should not only give the right to harvest but also the responsibility to manage the forest for long-term benefits. As long at these criteria are fulfilled, it doesn’t matter if the harvesting rights only cover a few commercial species, all species or just some NWFPs. If the concession is only a short-term harvesting right, it should be reported under “public administration” in table 4b.

### How to report when the ownership status is ambiguous (e.g. communities claiming ownership, disputed ownership, etc.)? 

The current legal status should be the guiding principle. If legally clear that the land is either public or private it should be reported so, although there may exist claims to the land.  Only when it is legally unclear or unknown, it should be reported as “Unknown ownership”. Special cases should be documented in detail in appropriate comment field to the table.
 
### Do public lands include leased lands?

They should be reported as “public” ownership in table 4a. What category to assign in table 4b depends on the length and other characteristics of the lease.

### Should indigenous territories be considered private (indigenous) or public with community user rights?

It depends on the national legislation and to what extent it grants legal rights to the indigenous people that correspond to the FRA definition of “ownership”, i.e. rights to “freely and exclusively use, control, transfer, or otherwise benefit from a forest. Ownership can be acquired through transfers such as sales, donations and inheritance.”  The country should assess whether this is the case and report accordingly.

### How to report public forests that are under co-management agreements (public administration + NGO or Community)?

In table 4a, report them as “Public”.  In 4b, report them under “Other” and explain in “comments to data” how this co-management agreement is set up.

--

# 6b Area of permanent forest estate <!-- section:6b -->

### The concept of Permanent Forest Estate (PFE) does not fit into the national context. How should I report?

If the concept of Permanent Forest Estate does not fit in the national context then select “Not applicable”. 

--

# 7a Non Wood Forest Products removals and value <!-- section:7a -->

### Can we include services, such as water, ecotourism, recreation, hunting, carbon, etc., in the NWFP table?  In other contexts we report on non-wood goods and services where these are included.

No, NWFPs are limited to goods only, defined as “tangible and physical objects of biological origin other than wood”. 

### How should we report on production of ornamental plants and crops growing under tree cover?

They should be included if collected in the wild. If planted and managed they should not be included as in such case they are not derived from forest but from an agricultural production system.

### How do we report on Christmas trees?

In FRA Christmas tree plantations are always considered as forests, consequently Christmas trees should be considered as NWFP (ornamental plants).

### What about products from multi-purpose trees often growing in agroforestry systems – should they be included as NWFPs?

The specifications and the definition of NWFP states that only non-wood products derived from forests should be included. So if the particular agroforestry system is considered to be “forest”, the non-wood products derived from multi-purpose trees are NWFPs and should be included in the reporting. 

### We only have a commercial value of processed products. How should we then report on value?

In general, the value should refer to the commercial value of the raw material. However, sometimes raw material value is not available and in such cases you may report on the value of a processed or semi-processed product and clearly note this in the respective comment field.

### Are animals which are produced inside the forest considered NWFP? 

Yes, bush meat species production should be considered NWFP.  Domesticated animals should not be included as NWFP. 

### Can grazing be considered as fodder and therefore as a NWFP?

No, grazing is a service while fodder is a tangible good. So include fodder collected from the forest, but exclude grazing.
