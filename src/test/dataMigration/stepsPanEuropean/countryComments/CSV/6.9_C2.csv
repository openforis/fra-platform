This trend is expected to continue and accelerate as new initiatives concerning the increase in the use of renewable energy are started by both the government and industry. The main initiative concerning this matter is the Energy Agreement which was signed in 2013 by the Dutch government, the industry, NGO's and the unions. They agreed to decrease the total energy consumtion by 1,5% per year and increase the share of renewable energy from the current 4% of the total energy consumption to 14% by 2020."
