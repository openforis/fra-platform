In 2005 about 22 500 ha of forest land was designated for recreationa purposes in state forests by State Forest Management Centre. In 2018 State Forest Management Centre managed 18400 ha of forestland with heigh public interest which can be equalled to public recreation areas. There is no category ""recreational forest"" used in forest management planning or other  inventories.
