42,ITA,1.3a,Forest: even-aged stands,"This class and un-even aged stands do not include specialised stands (for non wood products such as cork, seeds and fruits) and young forest originated by natural expansion on former agricultural or abandoned land. For that reason the total area of even-aged and uneven-aged forests presented in the forms 1.3a and 1.3b is smaller than the total forest area reported for ITA. Data on even-aged forest area by development phase (Tab. 1.3a1) derives from NFI data on stand age and is consistent with SoEF 2011 figures. Distribution by forest type derives also from NFI data (predominance of conifers/broadleaves).  Figures in Tab.1.3a2 resulted from an ""ad hoc"" calculation based on 2005 NFI plot data. In order to make specific volume estimations, NFI plots were assigned to different forest types and development phases.To calculate volume available for wood supply, three different coefficients for conifers/broadleaves and mixed stands were used. As no volume data per forest type was available for 1990 (IFNI85), trends of volume by forest type and development phase were calculated only for years 2000 and 2010 by applying 2005 ratio observed (NFI2) to total growing stock.","In the observed period even-aged stands in regeneration phase are shrinking, while those in intermediate and mature phase are enlarging."
