The differences in the data reported for 2015 compared to the latest data supplied is due to a difference modelling approach, which has a large influence on deadwood.   The previous model used for FRA 2015 excluded below ground deadwood stock. The inclusion of below ground stocks and the multiple component pool decay and transfer models in the new CDM model result in a much higher accumulation of deadwood, when compared to previous models. The previous models only used a one pool decay model which did not consider fragmentation and transfer of deadwood between pools.   Also, I think the predominance of the clearfell silvicultural system in IRL gives rise to large volumes of deadwood. The uptake of thinning in our maturing private estate is also another reason why deadwood volume has been increasing."

The Basic Wood Density of Stem wood (=0,439) for 2000 was estimated using the species composition. The rate was used for the estimation of biomass for 1990, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020 as well. The biomass of foliage, needle and root was estimated as percentage from the total stem volume using the models, designed by V.Usolcev for separate tree species. The biomass of branches was estimated, using native tables and data of NFI. Weighted percentages of over ground biomass were estimated as weighted percentages of stem volume of separate tree species (2000). For estimation of above-ground biomass, were used such factors: for coniferous – 1.221, for broadleaves – 1,178 from the stem biomass. It was drawn mean weighted factor for all tree species (1.202) what was applied also in calculations for 1990, 2005 and 2010 year.",

It was estimated that every year in coniferous stands due to self-thinning in the forest remains and are not consumed 1.43 m³ of stems, 0.24 m³ roots and branches, what decay during  15 years. The estimated average volume of dead wood per ha is 25 m³. In the broad-leaved stands in average 1.6 m³ of stems and 0.4 m³ of branches and roots remains in forests every year due to self-thinning.

According to that, carbon amount in litter is:      ((27*62.05)+(26*37.95))/100=26.62 t/ha 25.22% of broadleaved forests grow in dry and 74.78% - in moist soils. Carbon amount in the broadleaved forests is:       ((28*25.22)+(16*74.78))/100=19.03 t/ha Coniferous forests cover 61.16 % of total forest area of LTU and broadleaved forests cover the rest 38.84 %. According to that, the average carbon amount in all LTUn forest is:      ((26.62*61.16)+(19.03*38.84))/100= 24 t/ha The estimated amount of carbon (24 t/ha) was used for calculations of carbon amount stored in “Forests” and “Other wooded land” for the year of 1990, 2005,2010, 2015 and 2020.",

The biomass expansion factor that is used to calculate the total tree biomass in m³ is 1.2.,
181,NLD,1.4,Carbon stock in below-ground living biomass,To calculate the below-ground biomass the conversion factor for the conversion of 1 m³ of tree volume to the dry weight of stump and roots of 0.201 is used for both coniferous and deciduous species.,

From other inventories (SYHI and Woodstock) on forest holdings in which lying dead trees are measured, it is estimated that about 1 per cent (of the growing stock volume) extra volume is from lying dead trees. Based on the results of the above mentioned inventories the biomass stock in lying dead trees is calculated and added to the volume in standing dead trees. For the year 2005, 2015 and 2020 the standing and lying dead wood volume are derived from the results of the 5th and 6th national forest inventory and extrapolated with implemented trends respectively.",

The calculation is performed at the level of the individual forest stands and 20 tree species (including 2 groups: other conifers and other broadleaves) using the available stand parameters, yield tables and models. The total volume is based on the average growing stocks in the different age classes for individual tree species as the sum of the volumes in the different age classes. For individual tree species are specified ""biomass expansion factors"" for conversion to the total tree volume, ""wood density"" at dry weight, ""ratio for calculation of below-ground biomass"" (0,2 for all tree species) and ""carbon fraction"" (0,5 for coniferous and 0,49 for broadleaved tree species).",The carbon stocks in above-ground biomass are increasing which is related also to the increase of total timber growing stock in forests
