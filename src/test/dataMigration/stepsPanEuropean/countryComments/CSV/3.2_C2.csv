60,FIN,3.2,General comments,"Data source: Natural Resouces Institute FIN, Statistical Services. All roundwood and woodfuel are here reported under bark, original data are over bark.",
61,FIN,3.2,Industrial roundwood removals – Volume,Prefilled data from FAOSTAT OK.,The demand for industrial roundwood has increased during the recent years.
62,FIN,3.2,Industrial roundwood removals – Value,National currency is EUR and here values are reported in nominal values (1000 EUR). Value calculations are based on unit values which are weighted averages of roadside (delivery) prices for each year.,
63,FIN,3.2,Woodfuel removals – Volume,"Prefilled data from FAOSTAT OK, except that of woodfuel 2012. In FAOSTAT database data seems to be correct.",
64,FIN,3.2,Woodfuel removals – Value,Unit value of woodfuel has been estimated as 90% of the weighted average of the delivery price of the birch pulpwood (nominal values).,
65,FRA,3.2,General comments,"All volumes are reported underbark but it would better to report overbark volumes, at least for woodfuel.",The difference between roundwood and woodfuel prices are small because roundwood includes industry wood whose value is lower than fuelwoods.
66,FRA,3.2,Industrial roundwood removals – Volume,"Data collected by the annual sector survey ""forest harvesting"" carried out by the ministry of agriculture. From 2005, all volumes are reported over bark. Between 1988 and 2004, the volumes were over or under bark, depending on the species and categories.The under bark volumes were converted into overbark volumes.","Industrial roundwood removals were disrupted by the 1999 and 2009 storms, but also by the economic crisis of 2008. Industrial roundwood removals were low in 2013, then they increased before settle down."
67,FRA,3.2,Industrial roundwood removals – Value,"Survey on the final value of forest harvested products until 2010, and survey on wood prices since 2011.",The marketed wood prices (in constant euros) are always affected by storms. They decreased significantly in years 2000 and 2009.  The average wood prices includes large disparities between different products.
68,FRA,3.2,Woodfuel removals – Volume,"For marketed wood, data from the annual sector survey ""forest harvesting"" carried out by the ministry of agriculture.The non-marketed fuelwood, coming from forests or not, is estimated accordingly to the French method exposed to the Eurostat forest statistics workgroup on the 11.26.2009 (see Eurostat Doc. Forest/2009WG/05).","The woodfuel removals declined steadily since 1992. This trend reverses at the end of the period, due to the development of policies in favor of fuelwood energies."
69,FRA,3.2,Woodfuel removals – Value,"No value are available for non-marketed fuelwood. Since it is the same product as marketed fuelwood, their value was used.","Unlike the industrial roundwood, the fuelwood prices are not much influenced by storms and economic crises."
70,GEO,3.2,General comments,"The information provided here is not considering the amount of wood, which has been extracted without authorization.
