14,AUT,4.2,Total area of forest by expansion/ regeneration type:,"In many older forests stands, retrospectively, it is impossible to identify, whether the regeneration happened naturally or artificially (by planting or deliberate seeding). For this reason the NFI doesn’t collect any information about origin of older stands. Due to this lack of any measured information concerning the origin of older stands, NFI experts derived estimates for each forest type (European Forest Types). For younger stands, NFI provides information on method of regeneration. NFI recorded a markable increase of natural regeneration. In 1994 (NFI 1992-1996) only 41% of regeneration areas without canopy cover were natural regenerated, in 2008 (NFI 2007-2009) the share amounted to 72% and in 2017 (NFI 2016-2018) to 83%.|Provided estimates for 1994, 2001, 2008, 2017 were adapted to reference years by inter- or extrapolation.",See left.

18,AUT,4.2,Annual forest expansion and regeneration:,"ANNUAL EXPANSION OF FOREST AREA (afforestation, natural expansion): Due to the fact that no appropriate annual data are available, forest expansion (afforestation, natural expansion) is calculated as annual area change between 1994 (NFI 1992-1996), 2001 (NFI 2000-2002), 2008 (NFI 2007-2009) and 2017 (NFI 2016-2018). The total expansion area between two NFIs is diveded by the number of years between the two NFIs. Figures for 1990 and 2000: Change 1994-2001 (NFI 1992/96-2000/02). Figures for 2005: Change 2001-2008 (NFI 2000/02-2007/09). Figures for 2010 and 2015: Change 2008-2017 (NFI 2007/09-2016/18).|ANNUAL REGENERATION OF FOREST AREA (natural regeneration, planting and seeding, coppice): The regeneration areas recorded by the NFI regeneration surveys are divided by 10 (planting and seeding) or 22 (natural regeneration). Natural regeneration is growing from a height of 10 cm to 130 cm on average within 22 years, artificial regeneration needs about 10 years from planting to a height of 130 cm. The annual regeneration area are derived from the four periods of NFI regeneration survey (NFI 1992-1996, NFI 2000-2002, NFI 2007-2009 and NFI 2016-2018). The rotation time of coppice is assumed to be 30 years. Thus the defined coppice area is divided by 30. Provided estimates for 1994, 2001, 2008 and 2017 (NFI 1992-1996, NFI 2000-2002, NFI 2007-2009 and NFI 2016-2018) were adapted to the reference years by inter- or extrapolation.",
19,AUT,4.2,Natural expansion of forest area,Forest expansion area excluding the afforestation divided by the years between two NFIs.,
20,AUT,4.2,Regeneration of forest area,Natural/artificial regeneration area (NFI regeneration survey) divided by 22 (natural) or 10 (artificial) (see above!) and the area with coppice within two NFI periods divided by 30 (see above!).,The decline of the artificial reforestation area is due to the fact that natural regeneration is more and more used for re-establishment of stands after final cut. This trend is clearly shown by NFI results but also by forest reproductive material statistics (decrease of forest plant production).

After entry SVK into EU the afforestation was realized within respective measures of the Plan of Rural Development. However afforestation in SVK is not priority because of relatively high forest percentage. Therefore there is obvious continuous decrease of this activity. In spite of mentioned facts the afforestation in 2015-2020 has doubled as compared to period 2010-2015, thanks to relatively large afforested area in 2016 and 2017."

Another reason of increasing reforestation is high volume of incidental felling, mainly after 2004. The share of natural regeneration has also been continuously increasing: from 10% in 1995 up to 40% in 2017."
