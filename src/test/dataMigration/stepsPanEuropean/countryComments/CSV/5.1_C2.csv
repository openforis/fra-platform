NFI category ""Schutzwald"" (protective forest) is based on the definition of ""Standortschutzwald"" (site-protecting forests), Forest Act , §21 (1): Forests on sites that are endangered by the eroding forces of wind, water and gravity, and which require special treatment to protect the soil and the plant cover and to ensure reforestation. Site-protecting forests are 1. forests on drift sand and drifting soil, 2. forests on locations with a tendency towards karstification or under severe risk of erosion, 3. forests in rocky, shallow grounded or precipitous locations, when reforestation is only possible under difficult conditions, 4. forests on slopes where dangerous landslips may be expected, 5. the forest cover in the timberline zone, 6. the forest belt immediately bordering the timberline zone.  Treatment and use of site-protecting forests: According to Forest Act, § 22. (1) the owner of a protection forest shall treat this according to relevant local circumstances, in order to ensure that the plant cover is maintained in as stable a fashion as possible, is appropriate to the location, and has vigorous interior structure and prompt renewal.",
