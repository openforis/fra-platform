Standing deadwood is registered as all standing trees over bark with stumps (DBH≥7 cm) and all stumps after felling on inventory plots. Detailed measurements in the year 2005-2006 showed total volume amounting to 12.4 m3 per hectar (tree without stump), or in  2015-2016 17.3 m3 per hectar respectively (tree with stump). For reporting only a part of standing deadwood was selected (sub-dataset with minimum 10 cm diamater); the total volume thus decreased to 8.7 m3 per hectar in 2015, and in 2005 6,6 m3 per hectar respectively.

Detailed measurements in the year 2005-2006 showed the total volume of lying deadwood 28.2 m3 per hectar (of which small-sized deadwood 10,4 m3), in the year 2015-2016 28.0 m3 per hectar respectively (of it small sized  8.7 m3).
