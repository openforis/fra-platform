4,AUT,4.3,,"Undisturbed by man: National naturalness class ""natural"" is reported. Natural (wihtout impact): Hemeroby value 9, ahemerob. This level comprises a forest stand featuring a natural composition of vegetation which coincides with the potential natural forest population on the given site. The current composition of tree species corresponds to the natural spectrum as regards the dominance distribution among the species. The composition of grass, weed, shrub, and moss does not include any indicator species of hemeroby. No exploitation was determined on these areas and therefore no anthropogenic disturbance appear in the forest structure either. This, however, does not exclude much earlier exploitation interventions which at present can only be subject to speculation. The forest structure corresponds to the natural composition of the stand. This means that the stand composition corresponds to the natural development steps that take place in a natural forest. Neither economic growth-classes nor selection phases."
5,AUT,4.3,,No plantations are reported as forests in AUT are not intensively managed and most planted/seeded stands resemble/will resemble at stand maturity naturally regeneration forest.

Original forest, is considered to be the forest, where species and spatial composition corresponds to the stand conditions. No indications of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed.  Natural forest - Forest established by natural processes but in past influenced by human activities (mostly by harvesting and pasture – not seeding and planting)"

Forest within the alpine area (mainly alpine birch areas).
