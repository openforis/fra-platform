3,BLR,1.3b,Опишите как вы определяли структуру диаметра:,
4,BEL,1.3b,Describe how did you determine diameter structure:,From all trees measured in NFI plots.
5,BIH,1.3b,Describe how did you determine diameter structure:,
6,BGR,1.3b,Describe how did you determine diameter structure:,
7,HRV,1.3b,Describe how did you determine diameter structure:,"The diameters measured at 1,30 m height are grouped in 3 diameter classes: 11-30 cm, 31-50 cm and >50 cm. For the purpose of this report, recalculation of growing stock into 4 diameter classes was carried out according to local selection forests models."
8,CYP,1.3b,Describe how did you determine diameter structure:,

10,DNK,1.3b,Describe how did you determine diameter structure:,Analysis was based on NFI measurements of individual trees
11,EST,1.3b,Describe how did you determine diameter structure:,All measured trees on sample plots were assigned to diameter classe
12,FIN,1.3b,Describe how did you determine diameter structure:,We did not classify any forests in uneven-aged forests
13,FRA,1.3b,Describe how did you determine diameter structure:,"on each NFI plot the circumference of all trees above 7.5 cm dbh is recorded with a precision of 1 cm. The diameter is calculated, considering the stem are perfect circle. 10 cm trees have a diameter between 9.5 and 10.5 cm."

31,NOR,1.3b,Describe how did you determine diameter structure:,
32,POL,1.3b,Describe how did you determine diameter structure:,"Despite some uneven-aged stands occur, all forests (also protected) were included into even-aged stands. Although, there are two storey stands in POL, but it doesn't  have influence on rotation length, so according to definition such stands were classified also as even-aged."
