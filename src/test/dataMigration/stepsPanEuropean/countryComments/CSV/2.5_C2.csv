90,DNK,2.5,Total area of degraded land,,"Historically, almost all of the forest in DNK was felled at the time of the first forest law (1805). The remaining forest (3-4% of the land area) was degraded by grazing and excessive use. The vast majority of the remaining land was depleted for nutrients by heavy grazing as expressed in the widespread formation of heather at the time. Afforestation was after 1805 used as one of the means to regain productivity of agricultural lands, heathers, and moors among other things by hindering sand drift. Based on the past 200 years of forest and agricultural history one may, depending on point of view, argue that all Danish lands are degraded or the opposite. In our view, the gain in productivity of most land in DNK during the last two centuries bear witness to the fact that hardly any land is degraded.",

93,DNK,2.5,Primary degraded by,air pollution,"The gain in productivity observed in Danish agriculture as well as forest management during the past 200 years is among other things related to fertilization. Depending on viewpoint, this may be viewed as degredation of natural nutrient cycles affecting flora and fauna. As the FRA2020 definition does not specify what is meant by ""degredation"" the question is in reality impossible to answer, but we have opted for using ""degredation"" in a productivity sense.",

There is no substantial areas of ""degraded"" forest land in SWE and therefore no need for the term.   Comment on the answer to the question on row 38: Non forest land that is suitable for forest growth and has no other land use is categorized as forest in the National Forestry act, regardles if the land is degraded or not. Which means that the land owner has an obligation of afforestation. If it is degraded to the point that it is not suitable for forest growth then it is not categorized as forest.",
