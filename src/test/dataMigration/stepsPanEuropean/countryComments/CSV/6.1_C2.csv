6,AUT,6.1,General comments,"The reported figures are for forest and OWL area.  The total FOWL area in table 6.1 does not sum up to the same totals as in table 1.1a. It’s caused by different assessment methods: NFI is based on sample plots; ownership data origin from the farm structure survey. According to the minimum size criteria of the farm structure survey very small forest holdings are not counted.  1990: 11-500 ha size class includes also all forest holdings >500 ha. 1990 figures are not comparable with 2000 and subsequent figures due to different minimum size rules (see ""Comments on trend(s)""!).  2000: Results of farm structure survey 1999 are used without adjustment of data for reference year.  2005 data: interpolated between 2000 and 2010.  2015: Results of farm structure survey 2016 are used without adjustment of data for reference year.","Minimum size of forest holding reported, ha: 1990: All holdings with forest area included in the Agricultural and Forestry Farm Census 1990. This census includes all agricultural, forestry and combined agricultural and forestry holdings within one of the following limits: 1. Total area of at least 1 ha; 2. Holdings with commercial vineyards or fruit trees of at least 25 ares, with areas under berries, strawberries, market-gardening or tree nurseries of at least 10 ares or with greenhouse; 3. Holdings with at least 1 cattle, 3 pigs, 5 sheep, 5 goats or 50 of any kind of poultry. 4. Mushroom or fish farms producing for the market and beekeeping with at least 20 colonies. 2000, 2010, 2016: All holdings with forest area included in the Farm Structure Surveys 1999 and 2010. These surveys include all agricultural, forestry and combined agricultural and forestry holdings within one of the following limits: 1. Holdings with a utilized agricultural area of at least 1 ha; 2. Holdings exclusively geared to forestry with at least 3 ha of woodland; 3. Holdings with commercial vineyards of at least 25 ares, with intensively-farmed areas of fruit trees of at least 15 ares, with areas under berries, strawberries, vegetables, flower and ornamental plants, vine and tree nurseries or forest tree nurseries of at least 10 ares or with greenhouse; 4. Holdings with at least 3 cattle, 5 pigs, 10 sheep, 10 goats or 100 of any kind of poultry and [only for FSS 1999:] producer of cultivated mushrooms for the market."

20,BGR,6.1,Area and number of holdings in private ownership,For private ownership – reliable data exists only for so called “forest cooperatives” where private owners with different size of ownership are united in one cooperative with common management. For other private owners there are no data available – there is statistics only for the owners. Unknown is marked with n/a because of the above comments,

27,CZE,6.1,General comments,"all figures regarding the number of forest holdings refers to number of Forest management plans/guidelines. Forest management guidelines is a simplier form of FMP prepared for small owners up to 50 ha. Particularly number of holdings within guidelines is more or less estimation as according to its nature its impossible to separate (join) individual owners accros all country. Methodology used for 2005 - 2015 figures is based on digital form of data, therefore could not be applied to 1990 and 2000. Previously reported figures seems quite inconsistent, therefore n/a is reported for these years.",

54,HUN,6.1,General comments,"Data have been corrected since the last submission. In the Hungarian Forest Database we have only three types of ownership: state, private and communal. The last involves municipal forests and forests of various communities (churches, foundations etc.). Formerly, all communal forests were classified as public forests. For the present submission, we divided communal forests according to forest managers (classification of which is much more sophisticated). Thus, communal forests managed by municipalities were assumed to be owned by a municipality.",

63,ITA,6.1,General comments,"Referring to the proportion of public and private forest ownership, the same percentage of  2005data has been used. There is no national definition of forest holding. Official data on number and size of holdings, provided by the Agricultural Census is not consistent with the reference data sets on FOWL extent and thus, not usable. In absence of specific data, the percentage of public and private ownership in OWL is assumed to be equal to the one in Forest area. The category ""Other ownership"", as defined by FRA 2010, is not represented: Italian Forest is either privately or publicly owned. As the provisional results of NFI2015 do not provide any updated information on the division of the forest area into ownership categories, data for the reporting year 2015 are not available.",

66,LVA,6.1,General comments,"Total area of forest is distributed between ownership categories proportionally to the one obtained from land use balance, because such detailed distribution can not be obtained from State Forest Register and total forest area is different if these two data sources are compared. In case of local government forests and private forests holding is equal to one parcel - not according to definition. That means that actual number of holdings according to definition is less than number given in the table.",

91,NLD,6.1,Area and number of holdings in public ownership,All forest owners in the NLD that own a forest area of more than 5 ha untill recently had to register at the Bosschap. Approximately 70 per cent of the Dutch forest area is covered this way. The other 30 per cent of the forest belongs to forest owners that own less than 5 ha of forest. The number of forest owners in this group is not known. For this reason the number of forest owners owning a forest area of less than 5 ha is estimated. This estimate is derived by dividing the forest area that is not registered at the Bosschap by 3 ha. This value of 3 ha is an estimation of the average size of the forest holdings in the group of forest owners owning less than 5 ha of forest. 30% of this group are expected to be private forest owners.The general perception is that this number of forest owners in approximately 30.000.,The values for the year 2015 have changed (decreased slightly) as a consequence of the new insight in total forest area

93,NOR,6.1,General comments,"The difference between total forest area (as reported in table 1.1) and the reported sum of private and public ownership is considered unknown ownership. Unknown ownership does not necessarily mean that the ownership of a forest holding is undeclared or disputed, but is more often caused by missing data in public registers or a discrepancy between the forest area assessed by the NFI and the public registers.",
