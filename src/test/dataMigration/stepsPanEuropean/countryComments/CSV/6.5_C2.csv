ELFS is sample-based survey. Starting from the year 2000 the survey is a continuous survey providing quarterly and annual results. The reference weeks for the households in the sample are spread uniformly throughout the whole year, e.g. for every week of the year same number of interviews is done. The target population of the survey are the working-age residents of EST (aged 15–74).  The estimates that are based on less than 20 persons of the sample have not been published  as not sufficiently reliable (marked N/A in present table).",

There is no further information on the employment in that report. Most probably this figure was not including information for all forest management bodies therefore it has been adjusted. In the Forest Europe, report in 2015 there is no information on the workforce under 6.5 and 6.6. There is no information available about the education and job characteristics.",
