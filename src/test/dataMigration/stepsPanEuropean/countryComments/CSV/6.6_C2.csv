Injuries/accidents are categorised into 3 categories: A) fatal - leading to death, B) heavy - leading to ablation, and C) Other heavy injuries. Records refer to absence from work for over 3 days time. National statistics further detail the fatal accidents by short anonymised descriptions of cases. Data is recorded according to work safety and injury reports of employers to the National Labour Inspectorate and Agency. Yearly and quarterly reports on occupational accidents are available as from 2000. For the years 2001-2007 additional data service specifically for forestry was provided from the NLIA for the purpose of SoEF 2015. This classification and related national records are based on the act Nr. XCIII from 1993 on work safety and protection.",

The national legislation on security and health at work defines ""worker"" as the person employed by an employer, including students in practice. The data regarding the reference population for employees is provided from an annual NSI survey regarding Salary earnings and labour cost conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and represents the number of employees at 31 December. In order to correlate with the national methodology for collecting accidents at work data (by the main activity of the employer), reference population data are aggregated on the basis of the main activity of the employer.","Beginning with 2008 reference year, accidents at work are reported by NACE rev.2. and the annual rate is calculated using the number of employees aggregated on the basis of the main activity of the employer.
