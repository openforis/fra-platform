113,EST,6.4,Gross fixed capital formation in equipment and buildings,"•         Other buildings and structures (AN.112)  - Other buildings and structures consist of buildings other than dwellings, other structures and land improvements, as defined below. Uncompleted buildings and structures are included to the extent that the ultimate user is deemed to have taken ownership, either because the construction is for own use or as evidenced by the existence of a contract of sale/purchase. Buildings and structures acquired for military purposes are included. The value of other buildings and structures is net of the value of land underlying them, which is included in land (AN.211) if separately classified. •         Machinery and equipment (AN.113) - Transport equipment, information and communication technologies (ICT) equipment, and other machinery and equipment, as defined below, other than that acquired by households for final consumption. Tools that are relatively inexpensive and purchased at a relatively steady rate, such as hand tools, may be excluded. Also excluded are machinery and equipment integral to buildings, which are included in dwellings and non- residential buildings. Uncompleted machinery and equipment is excluded, unless produced for own use, because the ultimate user is deemed to take ownership only on delivery of the asset. Machinery and equipment other than weapons systems acquired for military purposes are included. Machinery and equipment such as vehicles, furniture, kitchen equipment, computers, communications equipment, etc., that are acquired by households for final consumption are not treated as an asset. They are instead included in the memorandum item consumer durables in the balance sheet for households. Houseboats, barges, mobile homes and caravans used by households as principal residences are included in dwellings.",
114,EST,6.4,Other gross fixed capital formation,"•         Dwellings (AN.111) - Buildings that are used entirely or primarily as residences, including any associated structures, such as garages, and all permanent fixtures customarily installed in residences. Houseboats, barges, mobile homes and caravans used as principal residences of households are also included, as are public monuments (see AN.1121) identified primarily as dwellings. Costs of site clearance and preparation are also included. Examples include residential buildings, such as one- and two-dwelling buildings and other residential buildings intended for non-transient occupancy. Uncompleted dwellings are included to the extent that the ultimate user is deemed to have taken ownership, either because the construction is on own- account or as evidenced by the existence of a contract of sale/purchase. Dwellings acquired for military personnel are included because they are used, as are dwellings acquired by civilian units, for the production of housing services. The value of dwellings is net of the value of land underlying dwellings, which is included in land (AN.211) if separately classified. •         Cultivated biological resources (AN.115) - Livestock for breeding, dairy, draught, etc. and vineyards, orchards and other plantations of trees yielding repeat products that are under the direct control, responsibility and management of institutional units, as defined below. Immature cultivated assets are excluded unless produced for own use. •         Intellectual property products (AN.117) - Fixed assets that consist of the results of research and development, mineral exploration and evaluation, computer software and databases, entertainment, literary or artistic originals and other intellectual property products, as defined below, intended to be used for more than one year.",
