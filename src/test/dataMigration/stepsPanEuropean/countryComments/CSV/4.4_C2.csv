90,NLD,4.4,"Reference area for assessment (size of sample plot/average stand), ha:","For the year 1990 data from the 4th national forest inventory were used, which was a stand wise inventory. The dominant tree species of the stand is used to determine the area of introduced tree species for 1990 and 2000. For 2005 and 2015 basal area data from the 5th and 6th national forest inventory were used respectively, which was a plot based system. A plot in the NFIs represent a forest area of app. 121 ha and app. 117 ha respectively. The area for the year 2010 is the result of interpolation between the 2005 and 2015 areas. the area for 2020 is an extrapolation based on 2005 and 2015 with the newly calculated forest area implemented."
