91,NLD,4.3,FOWL: semi-natural,"Originally most of the forest area in the NLD was planted with a regular spacing and one or two species in even-aged stands with wood-production as the main purpose. A rapid change towards multifunctional forest (e.g. ecological values, recreation, wood production etc.), started in the seventies of the 20th century, had a large impact on the management of these even-aged stands. Forest management from then on was aiming at forest stands  with more variation in age and number of tree species. Wood production however, is still an important goal in forest management in the NLD. Natural regeneration plays an important role in the transformation process from the even-aged, monocultural stands into stands with more variation in age and tree species. Although a small part of the forest area consists of stands that have been cleared and re-established by (human influenced) natural regeneration, almost all forest area in the NLD originates from planted forest.",
