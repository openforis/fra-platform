The AUTn minimum Forest + OWL canopy cover is 30 percent. This causes a smaller area in comparison with the FRA 2020 definition of 10 percent. It is assumed that both differences cancel out each other. This assumption was proofed true by a supplementary assessment according to the FAO forest definition as part of the NFI 2007-2009 and 2016-2021 assessment.,

In some cases the regeneration time could be prolonged by state forest authority. - An unknown part of the approx. 6 000 ha of dwarf pine is not a regular forest according to the FRA definition (it mostly does not reach a height of 5 m in situ): these dwarf pine groups (""spots""), mostly mixed with spruce, form parts - larger or smaller than 0.5 ha - of regular forest stands mainly in high mountains. Here, these (roughly 0,2 % of total forest area) are included into ""forest"" because they are used and protected like regular forest stands having more non-wood producing functions than a regular forest has.

148,SVK,1.1,Forest area,"Forest is Forest land (forest stands described in Forest Management Plans) spanning more than 0.3 hectares, with canopy cover of more than 30 percent, with trees higher than 5 meters or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.                                                                                      Forests are Forest lands: - covered by forest stands, - where forest stands were removed temporarily and shall be regenerated -  reforested (clearings after felling), - skidding roads and dividing lines on forest lands up to 4 m wide;  - with industrial plantations. Except forests on forest lands there are also another 288 000 hectares of forest in SVK occurring on agricultural or other lands that were identified by the National Forest Inventory and Monitoring. However, not all of the information is known for them and, therefore, we report only the data for ""official forest area"" within this reporting for SoEF 2020. The Act on Forests doesn´t apply on forests outside forest lands. The trees outside forest lands above 13 cm in diameter are partially protected by the Act on Nature Conservation.","Since the first forest inventory in the years 1949-53, the area of both ""Forest lands"" and ""Forest stands"" have increased. This long-term increase in the forest area further continues. Since 2001, the area of forest crop land increased by more than 18,9 ths. ha. Forest cover, estimated as a percentage of forest land from the total country area, reached 41.2% in 2017.   Dwarf pine stands have traditionally been included among forests in SVK. They are also contained in Forest management plans. Since this reporting for SoEF 2020 we have for the first time classified dwarf pine stands as ""Other wooded land"" and that is why the ""Forest areas"" recorded in current SoEF 2020 reporting don’t match with those in SoEF 2015 and earlier."

So, these areas are defined as ""other wooded land"". There are larch, red pine, scotch pine, juniper species in the other wooded land.  In FRA 2020 terms and definitions, the forest was described as ""Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use."" Although the open forests have less than 10 percent, these areas have the potential to exceed 10 percent of canopy cover in the future. So, the open forest areas are accepted as forest areas. In addition, it was decided that open forest areas would be included in the forest definition in both the Geneva and Mexico meetings."
