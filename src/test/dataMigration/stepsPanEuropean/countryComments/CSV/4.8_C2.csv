104,FRA,4.8,General comments,"In the previous reportings, for ""total of taxa"" the number of forest species which had been set in the red list by experts were reported. As it was not the total number of species of taxa, but only those evaluated in the framework of the elaboration of the red lists, all the former data have been deleted. For "" threatened forest species"" it included species living in forests, species requiring the presence of trees and species not living in forests but regularly or seasonally present in forests.  2000 and 2005 data were based on old books (for birds : Rocamora & Yeatman-Berthelot : ""Oiseaux menacés et à surveiller en FRA"" (1999) and for other vertebrates : Maurin ""Inventaire de la Faune menacée en FRA"" (1994)). They use a ""Red list"" method which is not longer valid. The Red List project was launched in FRA in 2007. A new method was set up. It is developed  by the French IUCN Comity and the French National Museum of Natural History (http://www.iucnredlist.org/documents/redlist_cats_crit_fr.pdf).","Since the methods are different, no comparison can be made between current and previous data. Between 2010 and 2015 the method is the same but some red list have been updated"

305,SVN,4.8,Endangered trees,"Rules on the inclusion of endangered plant and animal species in the Red List (Ur.l. RS št. 82/02 and 42/10), annex Pteridophyta & Spermatophyta) and other categories of potentially endangered tree species is the main source.  The following tree species are very rare (R category): Acer tataricum, Celtis australis, Cercis siliquastrum, Phillyrea latifolia, Quercus crenata, Quercus ilex, Quercus virgiliana. Due to rareness are potentially endangered.  Betula nana is extinct species in our country. Potentially endangered are also Ilex aquifolium and Taxus baccata (O1 category). Laburnum alschingeri and Corylus maxima are less known species with very few data (K category).",Vulnerable species could be also all species in R annex.

309,SVN,4.8,Endangered invertebrates,"Reported values refer to orders of Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Opiliones, Araneae, Dermaptera. Order of Lepidoptera has no distinction between forest and non-forest species.",
310,SVN,4.8,Endangered vascular plants,Reported values refer to Pteridophyta and Spermatophyta (Red List). Distinction between the forest and non-forest vascular plant species is not possible – only total number of threatened species could be reported. Critically endagered species refer to species nominated with Ex? in Red list.,Summary of Red list species has been made.
311,SVN,4.8,Endangered cryptogams and fungi,"Reported values refer to fungi (22), mosses (261) and lichens (88). Distinction between the forest and non-forest cryptogam species (including lichens and bryophtes) is not clear enough – only the estimation of number of threatened species (forest and non-forest) could be reported.",
