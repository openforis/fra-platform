Provisional results of photointerpretation (first phase of NFI2015) have been used to update Forest and OWL area for the years 2010 and 2015 (see comments to Table 1.1).  the total GS extrapolated for the year 2010 was divided among the main species by applying the proportion of species observed in the NFI2005.
