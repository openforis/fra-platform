188,SVK,3.1,Total fellings,Felled wood under bark with diameter over 7 cm. Top and branches less than 7 cm are not included in total fellings (they amount about 12% of total fellings). Volumes of fellings were converted into the volumes over bark by using this average conversion coefficient for bark 1.105795 (1.091838 for coniferous and 1.118893 for non-coniferous tree species). The conversion coefficients were derived from the data collected in National Forest Inventory and Monitoring 2015-2016. Previously reported data were recalculated by means of new conversion coefficients.,"The main factor behind increased felling capacity and actual fellings is the current age structure of forests in SVK and their ever increasing growing stock, especially in forests over 70 years of age (8th and above age classes). This is caused by a higher than normal area of forests in mentioned age classes. These forests are mature and thus of felling age. As a result, the volume of planned felling has gradually grown and reached 9.69 million m3 in 2016. Over the last 20 years (compared to 1996), the planned felling almost doubled; it increased by 96%. In spite of these facts, realised felling is still lower when compared to the total current increment which was 12.0 million m3 in 2017."
189,SVK,3.1,Fellings of natural losses,"Fellings of natural losses include felling of dead and heavy damaged trees (trees not able to survive) because of natural cause, e.g. by natural mortality, diseases, insects attacks, fire, windthrow or other physical damage. Volumes of fellings were converted into the volumes over bark by using following average conversion coefficient for bark 1.105795 (1.091838 for coniferous and 1.118893 for non-coniferous tree species) derived from the data of NFIM 2015-2016 including data for previously reported years.","Fellings of natural losses go up due to higher growing stock and higher occurrence of natural causes. The annual share of incidental (calamitous) felling from the total felling has fluctuated from 42% to 65% since 1990. The dramatic increase occurred after extensive damage to forests caused by windthrow  in November 2004 which triggered mass outbreaks of bark beetle species in coniferous forests (spruce forests in particular). Compared to the beginning of the 1990s, the volume of salvaged calamitous timber doubled or even tripled in some years following 2004. The felling increased again in 2014 and 2015 following the catastrophic windstorm on 15 May 2014."
