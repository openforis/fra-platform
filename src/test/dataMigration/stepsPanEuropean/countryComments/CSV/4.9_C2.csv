17,AUT,4.9,FOWL:  MCPFE Class 1.2,Most MCPFE Class 1.2 areas are FOWL areas in national parks.,The decrease in 2015 is mainly caused by using an improved (more recent) FOWL layer.
18,AUT,4.9,FOWL: MCPFE Class 1.3,"Natura 2000 FOWL areas are only classified, if targets relevant to forest management are in place. Most of relevant Natura 2000 FOWL areas correspond to MCPFE Class 1.3.",Designation and enactment of Natura 2000 areas is the main reason for the increase of MCPFE Class 1.3
19,AUT,4.9,FOWL:  MCPFE Class 2,,There are two main reasons for the decline in 2010: 1. Legal changes in the province Styria concerning landscape protection areas (forest management is no longer restricted). 2. Upgrade of protected areas (increase of MCPFE Class 1.3).

There is however no general data available on the degree of protection that lies on which part of these forests. Also, it is not known which part of the forests that are filled in for the different MCPFE classes above, lies within Natura2000 areas. Having said this, in 2018 we conducted a study, overlaying several digital maps to generate values for forest area in Strict forest reserves, National Parks and Natura2000 areas. Note that the huge increase in MCPFE Class 2 (and inability to generate a value for Class 1.3) is the result of a newly handled reporting method of Natura 2000.",
