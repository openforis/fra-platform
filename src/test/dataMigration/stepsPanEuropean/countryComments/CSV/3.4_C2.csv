150,NLD,3.4,General comments,"There is very little national data available on these kind of services specifically for forests. For example for tourism, Statistics NLD presents national data of the total revenues of the whole country. It is not possible to make a distinction which part of this revenue is related to forests. From the nature management organizations only the larger present yearly data on their revenues on some of these services. However, they do not make a distinction between forest and other nature areas.|To give an indication of the revenues from forest services, some examples are given here. In most cases it must be noticed that these revenues are not only related to the forest but also to other types of nature.|Recreational services:|· The state forest service has a revenue of 7 milion euro's from recreation in 2015. This amount is generated from excursions, rentals of houses and campsites and the sales of articles.|- Private forest owners create revenues from hunting licenses etc.||Environmental services|· In 2015 the Dutch government and provinces provided 83 million euro of subsidies to the state forest serive for forest and nature management. Private forest owners are also able to claim these subsidies. These subsidies are given for different types of services alltogether, like ecological, recreational, protective and historical services.  The height of the subsidy per hectare is dependent on the type of forest.",

The above presented value of recreational services is estimated on the basis of activities supplementary to traditional forest management, and does not include businesses exclusively dealing with travel and outdoor recreation. In 2004, a report prepared by a working group under the management of The Forest Owners Federation, concluded with a total turnover of 4.1 billion NOK (about 500 million EUR) related to hunting, fishing and other outdoor recreation (including sales of equipment etc.)",
