53,FRA,4.4,General,"A national list of introduced species (except for Pinus nigra that is considered as a native species in Corsica and as an introduced a species elsewhere) is used. Tree cover was used instead of basal area. The previous data were recalculated because the difference between introduced and indigenous species where done by cluster of species before and it led to some errors because some clusters could be formed with introduced and indigenous species. In the same spirit, table 4b. has been recalculated to separate data by species. It led to some modifications for Pines in 2010 and for most species in 2005 (because 2005 was calculated using a linear regression with more annual samples than it had been done before : 2005 to 2017). All the tree species with a total forest area under 20 000 ha have been grouped into the category ""Other introduced species"". The main tree species within this group are Atlas cedar, Japanese larch and american firs.",

84,ITA,4.4,General,"Data of table 4.4a are consistent with those in table 2a of the report FRA/CFQ2015; in the same table, figures on invasive species are different from those reported in SoEF2011 because of the correction of an input error in SoEF2011.  The area occupied by introduced species (table 4.4b) is much larger than the area of stands dominated by the same species, because of the different basal area thresholds used; it corresponds to the area of forest stands where the basal area of introduced species is more than 50% of the total basal area; these figures are different from official national estimates of forest categories dominated by the same species (for example Eucalyptus spp. plantations, that are equal to about 20 000 ha), because the latter derive from a classification of the forest type carried out in the field, in a larger plot and based on a different classification scheme and  a different procedure, that is based on crown coverage instead of on basal area percentage.","Even if the trend is not considerable fully representative, Black Locust is increasing (especially in coppice stands)  in area due to its adaptation to Italian environment and due to its great sprouting ability."

Regarding invasive scpecies; the NLD do not have invasive tree species as defined above (yet). However Prunus serotina, currently defined as a shrub species, is considered to be invasive and is in many locations actively managed","Due to a shift in forest management to increase the share of native tree species the area of introduced tree species steadily declines.
