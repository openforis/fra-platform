1,ALB,2.5,2. Prefilling: This table has not been prefilled;
2,ALB,2.5,"3. Reference years: The figures for the reporting years refer to the situation in a reference year (1990, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015) noted in the Table, or in a nearest year for which data is available, not the averages of annually affected areas for the 5-year periods, e.g. 1988-1992 for 1990. National Correspondents are asked for degraded area present in a reference year. If for example degradation occurred in 2001, the area affected should be included in the reporting for 2005, only if area remains degraded still in 2005, as well as in the subsequent year(s) (2010) if relevant."
3,ALB,2.5,"4. Data sources: please specify sources separately for forest, other wooded land and total FOWL if sources differ."
4,ALB,2.5,"5. It is up to the countries to define the thresholds for the minimum size of degraded forest land and other wooded land to be reported as well as for criteria and detailed thresholds used to determine area as “degraded”. However, it is recommended to report only degradation that results in significantly hampered re-establishment of the stocking of the area (it does not have to be actually planned, but it has to be obvious that, if the case, it would be hampered). If the stocking is re-established, the area is considered restored."
5,ALB,2.5,6. “Primarily degraded” is mainly related to the severity of the influence on degradation. The area degraded by various agents (no matter which kind of agent and how many subsequent agents) should be counted just once.
6,ALB,2.5,"7. Sub-class “Primarily degraded by grazing”: this category usually includes land degraded (eroded and poor in humus) by various domestic animals (degradation by wild animals is expected to be rare). This type degradation typically takes place on non-forest land; however, the affected plots are many times left for forest expansion or decided to be afforested. Please use “Country comments” to specify if these plots are considered to be degraded forest land in your country, and if you have sufficient information for their monitoring and reporting."
7,ALB,2.5,"8. Sub-class “Primarily degraded by repeated fires”: this sub-class is expected to be more common on forest land, however, degraded regularly burned pastures also belongs to this sub-class. Please use “Country comments” to specify if these plots are considered to be degraded forest land in your country, and if you have sufficient information for their monitoring and reporting."
8,ALB,2.5,"9. Sub-class “Primarily degraded by air pollution”: air pollution can cause the changes in pH, leaching of nutrients, crusts on the soil surface, etc. Please use “Country comments” to specify if these plots are considered to be degraded forest land in your country, and if you have sufficient information for their monitoring and reporting."
9,ALB,2.5,"10. Sub-class “Primarily degraded by desertification”: this type of degradation is mostly related to climate/weather influence possibly combined with fires, grazing, deforestation and other agents. Please use “Country comments” to specify if these plots are considered to be degraded forest land in your country, and if you have sufficient information for their monitoring and reporting."
10,ALB,2.5,"11. Sub-class “Primarily degraded by other agent(s)” comprises: repeated damage to forest stands, poor forest management, landslides, long-term changes in water table, etc. The agent(s), if relevant, has (have) to be named in the blank field in the table 2.5 header. Please use “Country comments” to characterise the agent that caused the degradation, and if these plots are considered to be degraded forest land in your country and if you have sufficient information for their monitoring and reporting."
11,ALB,2.5,12. Total area degraded should be the sum of degradation by individual sub-classes.
12,ALB,2.5,"13. A clear determination of a moment, when a degraded area is reversed to a normal situation is complex, difficult and can vary depending on a type of degradation. However, successful re-establishment of (nearly) full stocking should be considered a successful reclamation also in the cases when a normal productivity has not been restored yet.  Please use “Country comments” to specify in which point these plots start to be considered reclaimed in your country, if you have sufficient information for their monitoring and reporting, and when they start to be considered successfully reclaimed."

39,BLR,2.5,1. Связь с ОЛР/ОВЛР 2020: глобальная отчетность охватывает деградировавшие леса в таблице T5c.См. соответствующие руководящие принципы ОЛР/ОВЛР на://fra-platform.herokuapp.com/ and terms and definitions at http://fra-platform.herokuapp.com/definitions/en/tad#1a
40,BLR,2.5,2. Предварительное заполнение: Эта таблица не была предварительно заполнена.
41,BLR,2.5,"3. Справочные годы: данные за отчетные годы относятся к ситуации в отчетном году (1990, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015), указанном в Таблице, или в ближайший год, по которому имеются данные, а не средние значения ежегодно области на 5-летние периоды, например 1988-1992 годы в 1990 году. У национальных корреспондентов запрашивается деградировавшая территория, присутствующая в отчетном году. Если, например, деградация произошла в 2001 году, затронутая область должна быть включена в отчетность за 2005 год, только если область по-прежнему будет деградирована в 2005 году, а также в последующий год(ы) (2010 год), если это необходимо."
42,BLR,2.5,"4. Источники данных: укажите источники отдельно для леса, других лесистых земель и общего количества FOWL, если источники отличаются."
43,BLR,2.5,"5. Страны должны определить пороговые значения для минимального размера деградировавших лесных земель и других лесистых земель, о которых сообщается, а также для критериев и подробных пороговых значений, используемых для определения района как «деградировавшего». Тем не менее, рекомендуется сообщать только о деградации, что приводит к значительному затруднению восстановления в этом районе (это не обязательно должно быть запланировано, но должно быть указано, если что-то будет препятствовать) , Если древостой будет восстановлен, площадь считается восстановленной."
44,BLR,2.5,"6. “Прежде всего деградирование вызвано” в основном связано с серьезностью влияния деградации. Площадь, деградировавшая из-за различных агентов (независимо от того, какой агент и сколько последующих агентов) должна учитываться только один раз."
45,BLR,2.5,"7. Подкласс “Прежде всего деградация вызвана пастбищами”: эта категория обычно включает в себя деградировавшие земли (размытые и бедные на гумус) различными домашними животными (ожидается, что деградация из-за диких животных бывает редко). Такая деградация обычно происходит на нелесных землях; однако затронутые участки много раз предназначались для расширения лесов или было решено их залесить. Пожалуйста, используйте «Комментарии», чтобы указать, считаются ли эти участки деградировавшими лесами в вашей стране и если у вас имеется достаточная информация для их мониторинга и отчетности."
46,BLR,2.5,"8. Подкласс “Прежде всего деградация вызвана пожарами”: этот подкласс, как ожидается, будет более распространен на лесных землях, однако деградировавшие регулярно выжигаемые пастбища также относятся к этому подклассу. Пожалуйста, используйте «Комментарии», чтобы указать, считаются ли эти участки деградировавшими лесами в вашей стране и если у вас имеется достаточная информация для их мониторинга и отчетности."
47,BLR,2.5,"9. Подкласс “Прежде всего деградация вызвана загрязнением воздуха”: загрязнение воздуха может вызвать изменения рН, выщелачивание питательных веществ, трещины на поверхности почвы и т. д. Пожалуйста, используйте «Комментарии», чтобы указать, считаются ли эти участки деградировавшими лесами в вашей стране и если у вас имеется достаточная информация для их мониторинга и отчетности."
48,BLR,2.5,"10. Подкласс “Прежде всего деградация вызвана опустыниванием”: этот тип деградации в основном связан с воздействием климата / погоды, возможно, в сочетании с пожарами, выпасом животных, обезлесением и другими агентами. Пожалуйста, используйте «Комментарии», чтобы указать, считаются ли эти участки деградировавшими лесами в вашей стране и если у вас имеется достаточная информация для их мониторинга и отчетности."
49,BLR,2.5,"11. Подкласс “В основном деградирует изза  других агентов” включает: неоднократное повреждение лесных насаждений, плохое управление лесами, оползни, долгосрочные изменения уровня грунтовых вод и т. д. Агент (агенты), если таковы имеются, должны быть указанны  в пустом поле в таблице 2.5.Пожалуйста, используйте «Комментарии», чтобы указать, считаются ли эти участки деградировавшими лесами в вашей стране и если у вас имеется достаточная информация для их мониторинга и отчетности."
50,BLR,2.5,12. Общая площадь с повреждениями должна являться суммой площадей отдельных подклассов.
51,BLR,2.5,"13. Четкое определение момента, когда деградировавшая зона переходит в нормальное состояние, сложна и может варьироваться в зависимости от типа деграда-ции. Однако успешное восстановление (почти) полного запаса следует считать успешной мелиорацией также в тех случаях, когда нормальная производительность еще не восстановлена. Пожалуйста, используйте «Комментарии», чтобы указать, в какой момент эти участки начинают считаться восстановленными в вашей стра-не, если у вас есть достаточно информации для их мониторинга и отчетности, и когда они начинают считаться успешно восстановленными."

У национальных корреспондентов запрашивается деградированная территория, присутствующая в отчетном году. Если, например, деградация произошла в 2001 году, затронутая область должна быть включена в отчетность за 2005 год, только если область по-прежнему будет деградирована в 2005 году, а также в последующий год (годы) (2010 год), если это необходимо."
354,MDA,2.5,"4. Источники данных: укажите источники отдельно для леса, других лесистых земель и общего количества FOWL, если источники отличаются."
355,MDA,2.5,"5. Страны должны определить пороговые значения для минимального размера деградировавших лесных земель и других лесистых земель, о которых сообщается, а также для критериев и подробных пороговых значений, используемых для определения района как «деградированного». Тем не менее, рекомендуется сообщать только о деградации, что приводит к значительному затруднению восстановления в этом районе (это не обязательно должно быть запланировано, но должно быть указано, если что-то будет препятствовать) , Если древостой будет восстановлен, площадь считается восстановленной."
356,MDA,2.5,"6. “Прежде всего деградирование вызвано” в основном связано с серьезностью влияния деградации. Площадь, деградированная изза различными агентов (независимо от того, какой агент и сколько последующих агентов) должна учитываться только один раз."
357,MDA,2.5,"7. Подклассы  “Прежде всего деградация вызвана пастбищами”:эта категория обычно включает в себя деградированные земли (размытые и бедные на гумус) различными домашними животными (ожидается, что деградация иззв диких животных бывает редко). Такая деградация обычно происходит на нелесных землях; однако затронутые участки много раз предназначались для расширения лесов или было решено их залесить. Пожалуйста, используйте «Комментарии», чтобы указать, считаются ли эти участки деградированными лесами в вашей стране и если у вас имеется достаточная информация для их мониторинга и отчетности."
358,MDA,2.5,"8. Подклассы  “Прежде всего деградация вызвана пожарами”: этот подкласс, как ожидается, будет более распространен на лесных землях, однако деградированные регулярно сжигаемых пастбищ также относятся к этому подклассу.Пожалуйста, используйте «Комментарии», чтобы указать, считаются ли эти участки деградированными лесами в вашей стране и если у вас имеется достаточная информация для их мониторинга и отчетности."
359,MDA,2.5,"9.

360,MDA,2.5,"10. Подкласс “Прежде всего деградация вызвана опустыниванием”: этот тип деградации в основном связан с воздействием климата / погоды, возможно, в сочетании с пожарами, выпасом животных, обезлесением и другими агентами. Пожалуйста, используйте «Комментарии», чтобы указать, считаются ли эти участки деградированными лесами в вашей стране и если у вас имеется достаточная информация для их мониторинга и отчетности."
361,MDA,2.5,"11. Подкласс “В основном деградирует изза  других агентов” включает: неоднократное повреждение лесных насаждений, плохое управление лесами, оползни, долгосрочные изменения уровня грунтовых вод и т. д. Агент (агенты), если таковы имеются, должны быть указанны  в пустом поле в таблице 2.5.Пожалуйста, используйте «Комментарии», чтобы указать, считаются ли эти участки деградированными лесами в вашей стране и если у вас имеется достаточная информация для их мониторинга и отчетности."

363,MDA,2.5,"13. Четкое определение момента, когда деградированная зона переходит в нормальное состояние, сложна и может варьироваться в зависимости от типа деградации. Однако успешное восстановление (почти) полного запаса следует считать успешной мелиорацией также в тех случаях, когда нормальная производительность еще не восстановлена. Пожалуйста, используйте «Комментарии», чтобы указать, в какой момент эти участки начинают считаться восстановленными в вашей стране, если у вас есть достаточно информации для их мониторинга и отчетности, и когда они начинают считаться успешно восстановленными."
