The difference with the FAO definition is estimated to be less than 0,5 %. The growing stock and the distribution between coniferous and broadleaved trees are only available in FAWS.

181,NLD,1.2,Growing stock on forest area,"The fifth and sixth national forest inventory(NFI) are plot based inventories. Within the plots all trees with a minimum diameter of 5 cm are measured. Therefore the reported values differ from the FAO definition. In theory the growing stock could be calculated using the FAO definition. However, with the data from the 5th and 6th NFI, the sample size of trees in the plots would than be too low in order to get representative results. The growing stock, growth and removal survey (Houtoogststatistiek en prognose oogstbaar hout, HOSP) was a monitoring system of about 3,000 permanent plots, which covered about 310,000 ha of the 350,000 ha of forest in the NLD. No monitoring plots are established on about 40,000 ha of forest that meets the FAO definition (tree canopy cover > 10%) in this enquiry, but that has another type of land use, e.g. campsites, living areas, parks, zoological gardens. Changes in this area of 40,000 ha cannot be estimated based on the HOSP monitoring system. In order to be able to give an indication for the growing stock in this area the report of Daamen (2002) is used. According to Daamen the average growing stock per hectare over the area (40,000 ha) that is not included in HOSP should be estimated as 87 m3 ha-1. This value of 87 m3 ha-1 is also used to calculate the growing stock for the area (65,000 ha) that was not in the 5th NFI (MFV).",

223,SVK,1.2,Growing stock on forest area,"The original data on growing stock are based on national definitions in accordance with the forest act and related decrees. The growing stock is defined as the volume of all living trees with diameter at breast height more than 7 cm under bark. It includes the stem from stump up to the top with diameter of 7 cm.  The growing stock was converted into the over bark volume by following empirical conversion factors derived from the data obtained within the National Forest Inventory and Monitoring (2015-2016): NOR spruce 1,090438; European beech 1,08463; oaks 1,259711; pines 1,103717; European silver fir 1,102278; European hornbeam 1,077637; European larch 1,285266; maples 1,091881; ashes 1,240556; Black locust 1,302583; all conifers 1,102727; all broadleaves 1,129242; average for all tree species 1,119555. Also previous reporting years were recalculated according to listed new conversion factors.","The growing stock of broadleaved species is increasing. It reached 280 million m3 in 2017, an increase of 12,2% (30 million m3) on 2010 figures. Conversely, the stock of coniferous species has been falling since 2010 as a result of frequent natural disturbances in coniferous forests (spruce in particular). The coniferous stock fell by 5.7% (30 million m3) since 2010. The increase in the total growing stock has also been confirmed by the results of the 2nd cycle of the National Forest Inventory and Monitoring (NFIM SR) which shows an increase of 4,4% in a 10-year period. It can be said that, at present, due to the actual age composition of the forests in SVK, the historically highest growing stock is at least for the last century. However, the volume of present growing stock is already at the culmination point. It is expected that in the coming years and decades the growing stock will decrease as a result of the gradual change in age structure in SVK."
