930,NLD,1.1,Forest,364.83,"In 2017 a new study arose with a corrected national forest area for the NLD. This study showed a decline in Forest Area in the NLD in recent years as a consequence of transformation of forest into nature areas (heathercorridors, natural pastures, marches or waterbodies) in the light of Natura 2000. Besides this Natura 2000 development, temporary forests, planted in the late 80's and the beginning of the 90's, that were exempted from the reforestation law have been harvested in recent years.  This change in Forest Area (from 374.73 as reported in the 6th NFI, to 364.83) shows a very steep decline in forest area in the NLD. However it is likely that this deforestation has taken place in a gradual fashion over the last years instead of an instant decline during a few years.  Moreover, due to the new findings it seems likely that the old forest inventories and monitoring programs contain slight errors in the reported forest area; this resulted in an overestimated forest area. Currently there is an ongoing discussion wether and how to implement corrections.  They Forest Area in the years 2016-2020 have been generated according to an extrapolation based on linear interpolation between the years 1982 and 2015."
