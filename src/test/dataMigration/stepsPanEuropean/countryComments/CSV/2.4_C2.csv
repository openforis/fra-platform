In the last 15-20 years, forests in SVK are exposed to unprecedented frequency and intensity of damaging agents (abiotic, biotic) mainly due to the climate change. Because of the various obstacles (administrative, organizational, new nature conservation concepts etc.), the timely and thorough processing of damaged timber (by incidental fellings) has often not been ensured. Due to mentioned reasons we are currently witnessing the most serious damage to forests caused by biotic harmful agents (especially bark-insects) in the whole documented history of forests in SVK (volume of 3.9 million. m3 of timber was damaged by biotic damaging agents only in 2017). As a consequence of these facts, there is large extent of dead and damaged forests, but also of unplanned, often large-scale and by society negatively perceived clear-cutting carried out only in the interst of processing of damaged timber."

However the estimate of anuall area of forest fires is also an good estimate of present area damaged by forest fires, i.e. the trees on the anuall area damaged by fire one fire season will be cut and transported from the forest before the next fire season to prevent spread of insects like for exampel Ips typographus or Tomicus sp. Which means that damages by fire will only be present the current year. Forest owners are obliged to transport the damaged trees from the forest by the Forestry Act. Only in protected forests (like nature reserves and so on) is the trees left in the forest, fires in protected areas is however a minor part of the total area affected by fire.",
