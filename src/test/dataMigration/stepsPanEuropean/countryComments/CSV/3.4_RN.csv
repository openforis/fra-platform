97,BLR,3.4,"5. Валюта: Данные за каждый год должны быть указаны в отчете в государственной валюте. Страны должны ясно явно указать какая государственная валюта представлена в отчете (и за какие годы, если отличается) в таблице ""Национальная валюта в отчетных годах""."
98,BLR,3.4,"6. Рыночные услуги, указанные в отчете, должны зависеть от леса или в основном быть связанными с лесом, но необязательно должны выставляться на продажу владельцами леса (например, экологический туризм). Связанный с лесом, означает, что лес составляет необходимый элемент рыночной услуги. Просим при возможности предоставить информацию о типах услуг, включенных в разные классы в “Комментариях” и указать в отчете в соответствующих подклассах. Заметьте, что должны быть включены только рыночные услуги, включающие какие-либо финансовые операции, а не гипотетические цены услуг, которые в настоящее время являются бесплатными для пользователей / потребителей."

119,BLR,3.4,"9. Рыночные биосферные услуги включают в себя услуги, связанные с индикатором 4.6 (генная консервация генетических ресурсов на месте или вне места) так же, как и с индикатором 4.9 (охраняемая лесная площадь), например, защита природы на добровольной договорной основе с компенсацией или другими платежами от частных или государственных органов (включает в себя экологическую сеть защищенных зон на территории Европейского Союза Natura 2000). Данный класс также включает в себя проекты по лесоразведению, со связыванием углерода, в рамках киотского протокола. Если такие проекты будут включены, просим указать объем в “Комментариях”. Заметьте, что отчетность в данной категории является дополнительной к отчетности, в индикаторе 4.9. В то время как в индикаторе 4.9 главной задачей является определение качества защиты, здесь основное внимание уделено определению денежной стоимости рыночных или полу-рыночных операций для экологических услуг."

Просим использовать “Комментарии” для представления отчета о следующих критериях, используемых для включения разных услуг. Рекреационные услуги, не обменянные через рыночную операцию, не должны быть указаны в отчете (см. также индикатор 6.10)."
121,BLR,3.4,"11. К услугам, связанным с благоустройством, относятся те, которые связаны с духовными, культурными и историческими функциями, например священные, религиозные или другие формы духовного вдохновения, места поклонения, ландшафтные особенности (горы и водопады), «памятники» в пейзаже связанные с культурным прошлым, эстетическое наслаждение и вдохновение, исторические артефакты."

123,BLR,3.4,"13. Исходной площадью для отчетности является “Всего FOWL ”, не поделенная на подклассы “Лес” и “Прочая лесопокрытая земля”. Если имеются данные по некоторым лесным зонам, например, по государственным лесам или подклассу “Лес”, просим дать экспертную оценку по вероятной стоимости “Всего лес и прочих лесопокрытых землям”. Просим указать в отчете о действительно имеющихся данных, на которых основана экспертная оценка в “Комментариях”."

1389,UKR,3.4,"8. Marketed ecological services include those related to indicators 5.1 (protection of soil, water and other ecosystem functions as well as infrastructure and managed natural resources) on a voluntary contractual basis with compensation or other payments from private or public bodies."
1390,UKR,3.4,"9. Marketed biospheric services include services related to indicator 4.6 (in-situ or ex-situ gene conservation of genetic resources) as well as indicator 4.9 (protected forest area) e.g. nature protection on a voluntary contractual basis with compensation or other payments from private or public bodies (this includes Natura 2000). This class also includes carbon-sequestration related afforestation projects in the context of the Kyoto Protocol – should such projects be included, please specify the amount under “Country comments”. Note that the reporting under this category is complementary to reporting under indicator 4.9. While in indicator 4.9 the main objective is to determine the quality of protection, the main focus here is to determine monetary values from market or quasi-market transaction for environmental services."
1391,UKR,3.4,"10. Marketed social services include e.g. hunting or fishing licenses, renting of huts and houses as well as forest-based leisure, sport and outdoor adventure activities and educational services that are not free of cost to consumers (the public, schools ...). Please use “Country comments” to report on further criteria used for including different services. Recreational services not exchanged via market transaction are not to be reported. (see also indicator 6.10)."
1392,UKR,3.4,"11. Amenity services include those related to spiritual, cultural and historical functions, e.g. sacred, religious, or other forms of spiritual inspiration, sites of worship, landscape features (mountains and waterfalls), “memories’’ in the landscape from past cultural ties, aesthetic enjoyment and inspiration, historic artifacts."
1393,UKR,3.4,"12. Other marketed services include e.g. payments to woodland owners for licenses for gravel extraction, telecommunication masts, wind farms and electricity distribution."
1394,UKR,3.4,"13. The reference area for reporting is “Total FOWL”, not further divided into sub-classes “Forest” and “Other wooded land”. If data is available for some forest areas, e.g. for state forests or sub-class “Forest”, please give an expert judgment on the likely value for ”Total forest and other wooded land”. Please report on actually available data on which expert judgment is based under “Country comments”."
1395,GBR,3.4,1. Connection with FRA/CFRQ 2020: this reporting form has not direct counterparts in the global reporting.
1396,GBR,3.4,"2. Prefilling: This table has been prefilled with the data reported for the “State of Europe’s Forests 2015” (http://foresteurope.org/state-europes-forests-2015-report/).. National correspondents may use that data, if available, as the basis and maintain these figures, providing the international definitions and recommendations. If new data replaced previously reported values, national correspondents are invited to indicate the reason for changing the figures in “Country comments”."
1397,GBR,3.4,"3. Reporting on trends: The table demands information for 2015 only, or in a nearest year for which data is available, information on observed trends is welcome."
1398,GBR,3.4,"4. Data sources: please specify sources separately for forest, other wooded land and total FOWL if sources differ."
1399,GBR,3.4,5. Currency: Figures for each year should be reported in national currency. Countries should explicitly state what national currency is reported (and for what years if differing) in the National currency in the reporting years table.
1400,GBR,3.4,"6. Marketed services reported should be forest-dependent or mainly forest-related, but are not necessarily to be marketed by forest owners (e.g. eco-tourism). Forest-related means that forests constitute an essential element of the service marketed. Please provide information on types of services included in the different classes under “Country comments”, and report in appropriate sub-classes if possible. Note that only marketed services involving some kind of financial transaction should be included, and not hypothetical values of services that are currently free of cost to users/consumers."
