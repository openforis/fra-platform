4,ALB,3.2,"5. Roundwood is to be reported “under bark”, please report value(s) of conversion factors, if conversion from “over bark” was applied. “Total removals” include roundwood removed from all land-use categories, not only from forest or other wooded land."
5,ALB,3.2,6. The assessment of “Total removals” should also include wood that is removed for subsistence use with the value calculated on the basis of local roadside prices.

If a different basis is used (e.g. standing sales value), values should be converted to felled (roadside). In case where values are obtained from a point further down the production chain, transport costs and possible handling and/or processing costs should be discounted. Values and conversion factors used in the calculation should be provided in the comments."
