If data are available for sub-class “Forest” only, please report on this sub-class and provide note under “Country comments”. If data are available only for certain forest areas or ownership classes (e.g. state forests), but not for others, data should be reported for these areas or classes, which should be specified in “Country comments”."

It is defined as resident producers´ acquisitions less disposals of fixed assets during the accounting period plus certain additions to the value of non-produced assets (such as improvements in the quality or productivity of land) realised by the productive activity of producer or institutional units. Fixed assets are produced assets used in the production for more than one year. For this purpose gross fixed capital formation include: investments in accordance with the national tax laws (construction and maintenance of forest roads, buildings; investments to equipment, tools, vehicles, machinery and technologies and other investments e.g. IT and/or intangible investments etc.). Gross fixed capital formation is valued at purchasers´ prices, including installation charges and other costs of ownership transfer. “Gross fixed capital formation” are reported within three subcategories: “Gross fixed capital formation in planting of trees to provide regular income”, “Gross fixed capital formation in equipment and buildings” and “Other gross fixed capital formation”."
7,Albania,6.4,"8.      “Gross fixed capital formation in planting of trees to provide regular income” includes cultivation of land to create new forest plantations as mean of production of forest products (e.g. cork, natural gum and similar products). Fixed assets must provide annual income."

10,Albania,6.4,"11.   “Fixed capital consumption” is the value of the depreciation of fixed capital goods as a result of normal wear and tear in the course of production process. “Fixed capital consumption” are reported within three subcategories: “Planting of trees to provide regular income”, “Equipment and buildings” and “Other fixed capital consumption”."
11,Albania,6.4,"12.   “Capital transfers” include all receivable capital transfers, i.e. investment grants and other capital transfers. Investments grants are capital transfers, in cash or kind, effected by general government or the rest of the world to other resident or non-resident institutional units with the aim of financing, in part or in full, the cost of acquiring fixed capital goods. Investments grants from the rest of the world comprise those granted directly by the institutions of the European Union. Interest subsidies are not included under investments grants, even if they are intended to facilitate investments transactions. Other capital transfers cover transfers which redistribute saving or wealth among the different sectors of the economy. Other capital transfers may take the form of compensation to owners of capital goods that had been destroyed by acts of war or natural disasters, such as floods, etc. Other capital transfers also include compensation for exceptional losses of fixed capital goods used in the production of forestry goods and grants to compensate for reduction in the value of assets or to reduce debts. Investments grants and other capital transfers should be recorded when payment is due."

47,Беларусь,6.4,"12.   «Капитальные трансферты» включают все дебиторские капитальные трансферты, т. е. Инвестиционные гранты и другие капитальные трансферты. Инвестиционные гранты представляют собой капитальные трансферты наличными или осуществляемые правительством или остальным миром, другим институциональным единицам-резидентам или нерезидентам с целью частично или полностью финансировать расходы на приобретение товаров основного капитала. Инвестиционные гранты от остального мира составляют те, которые предоставляются непосредственно учреждениями Европейского Союза. Субсидии на проценты не включаются в инвестиционные гранты, даже если они предназначены для содействия инвестиционным сделкам. Другие переводы капитала охватывают переводы, которые перераспреде-ляют сбережения или капитал между различными секторами экономики. Другие трансферты капитала могут осущест-вляться в форме компенсации владельцам капитальных товаров, которые были уничтожены в результате военных дей-ствий или стихийных бедствий, таких как наводнения и т. д. Другие капитальные трансферты также включают компен-сацию за исключительные потери основных средств, используемых при производстве лесных товаров и грантов, что-бы компенсировать снижение стоимости активов или уменьшить задолженность.

Gross fixed capital formation is valued at purchasers´ prices, including installation charges and other costs of ownership transfer. “Gross fixed capital formation” are reported within three subcategories: “Gross fixed capital formation in planting of trees to provide regular income”, “Gross fixed capital formation in equipment and buildings” and “Other gross fixed capital formation”."
