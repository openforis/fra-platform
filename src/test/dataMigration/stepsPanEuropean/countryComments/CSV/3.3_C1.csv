The Royal Dutch hunters association (KNJV) estimates that 80% of these animals are sold to poultries, butchers and restaurants. This 80% is considered as marketed. The value is determined by using an average price per kg and multiplying this price with the total weight of all the animals that were shot. The total weight of these animals is determined by multiplying the average weight of the species by the number of forest occurring species that were shot. The average weight for each species is a best expert guess by the Royal Dutch hunters association and Vereniging het edelhert. Only the species that mainly occur in forests are included in the bush meat. Species such as wood-pigeons are not included in this category, because they are mainly shot on agricultural land and hardly in forests.",

The inland production was estimated to be 750.000 in 2005. The total value was calculated from the average price per Christmas tree from the export with the estimated total number of produced Christmas trees. Also it is not known which part of the total numer of Christmas trees comes from forests and which part from nurseries, but the main part (>90%) is probably grown on nurseries.
