    "disclaimer": "FAO has been monitoring the world's forests at 5 to 10 year intervals since 1946. The Global Forest Resources Assessments (FRA) are now produced every five years in an attempt to provide a consistent approach to describing the world's forests and how they are changing. The FRA is a country-driven process and the assessments are based on reports prepared by officially nominated National Correspondents. If a report is not available, the FRA Secretariat prepares a desk study using earlier reports, existing information and/or remote sensing based analysis.",
